<h2>PROEM</h2>

<p>In most histories of Italian art we are conscious of a
vast hiatus of several centuries, between the ancient classic
art of Rome&mdash;which was in its decadence when the Western
Empire ceased in the fifth century after Christ&mdash;and that
early rise of art in the twelfth century which led to the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>This hiatus is generally supposed to be a time when
Art was utterly dead and buried, its corpse in Byzantine
dress lying embalmed in its tomb at Ravenna. But all
death is nothing but the germ of new life. Art was not a
corpse, it was only a seed, laid in Italian soil to germinate,
and it bore several plants before the great reflowering
period of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The seed sown by the Classic schools formed the link
between them and the Renaissance, just as the Romance
Languages of Provence and Languedoc form the link
between the dying out of the classic Latin and the rise of
modern languages.</p>

<p>Now where are we to look for this link?</p>

<p>In language we find it just between the Roman and
Gallic Empires.</p>

<p>In Art it seems also to be on that borderland&mdash;Lombardy&mdash;where
the <i>Magistri Comacini</i>, a mediæval
Guild of <i>Liberi Muratori</i> (Freemasons), kept alive in their
traditions the seed of classic art, slowly training it through
Romanesque forms up to the Gothic, and hence to the full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">vi</a></span>
Renaissance. It is a significant coincidence that this
obscure link in Art, like the link-languages, is styled by
many writers Provençal or Romance style, for the Gothic
influence spread in France even before it expanded so
gloriously in Germany.</p>

<p>I think if we study these obscure Comacine Masters we
shall find that they form a firm, perfect, and consistent link
between the old and the new, filling completely that ugly
gap in the History of Art. So fully that all the different
Italian styles, whose names are legion&mdash;being Lombard-Byzantine
at Ravenna and Venice, Romanesque at Pisa and
Lucca, Lombard-Gothic at Milan, Norman-Saracen in
Sicily and the south,&mdash;are nothing more than the different
developments in differing climates and ages, of the art of
one powerful guild of sculptor-builders, who nursed the
seed of Roman art on the border-land of the falling Roman
Empire, and spread the growth in far-off countries.</p>

<p>We shall see that all that was architecturally good in
Italy during the dark centuries between 500 and 1200 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
was due to the Comacine Masters, or to their influence. To
them can be traced the building of those fine Lombard
Basilicas of S. Ambrogio at Milan, Theodolinda's church at
Monza, S. Fedele at Como, San Michele at Pavia, and San
Vitale at Ravenna; as well as the florid cathedrals of Pisa,
Lucca, Milan, Arezzo, Brescia, etc. Their hand was in the
grand Basilicas of S. Agnese, S. Lorenzo, S. Clemente, and
others in Rome, and in the wondrous cloisters and aisles of
Monreale and Palermo.</p>

<p>Through them architecture and sculpture were carried
into foreign lands, France, Spain, Germany, and England,
and there developed into new and varied styles according to
the exigencies of the climate, and the tone of the people.
The flat roofs, horizontal architraves, and low arches of the
Romanesque, which suited a warm climate, gradually
changed as they went northward into the pointed arches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span>
and sharp gables of the Gothic; the steep sloping lines
being a necessity in a land where snow and rain were
frequent.</p>

<p>But however the architecture developed in after times,
it was the Comacine Masters who carried the classic germs
and planted them in foreign soils; it was the brethren of
the <i>Liberi Muratori</i> who, from their head-quarters at
Como, were sent by Gregory the Great to England with
Saint Augustine, to build churches for his converts; by
Gregory II. to Germany with Boniface on a similar mission;
and were by Charlemagne taken to France to build his
church at Aix-la-Chapelle, the prototype of French Gothic.</p>

<p>How and why such a powerful and influential guild
seemed to spring from a little island in Lake Como, and
how their world-wide reputation grew, the following scraps
of history, borrowed from many an ancient source, will, I
hope, explain.</p>

<p>It is strange that Art historians hitherto have made
so little of the Comacine Masters. I do not think that
Cattaneo mentions them at all. Hope, although divining
a universal Masonic Guild, enlarges on all their work as
Lombard; Fergusson disposes of them in a single unimportant
sentence; and Symonds is not much more diffuse;
while Marchese Ricci gives them the credit of the
early Lombard work and no more. I was led at length to
a closer study of them by the two ponderous tomes on the
<i>Maestri Comacini</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by Professor Merzario, who has got
together a huge amount of material from old writers, old
deeds, and old stones. But valuable as the material is,
Merzario is bewildering in his redundancy, confusing in his
arrangement, and not sufficiently clear in his deductions, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
chief aim being to show how many famous artists came
from Lombardy.</p>

<p>I wrote to ask Signor Merzario if I might associate his
name with mine in preparing a work for the English public,
in which his research would furnish me with so much that is
valuable to the history of art, but to my regret I found he
had died since the book was written, so I never received his
permission; though his publisher was very kind in permitting
me to use the book as a chief work of reference. With
Merzario I have collated many other recognized authorities
on architecture and archæology, besides archivial documents,
and old chronicles. I have tried to make some
slight chronological arrangement, and some intelligible lists
of the names of the Masters at different eras. The researches
of the great archivist Milanesi in his <i>Documenti
per la Storia dell' Arte Senese</i>, and Cesare Guasti in his
lately published collection of documents relating to the
building of the Duomo of Florence, have been of immense
service in throwing a light on the organization of the
Lodges and their government. All that Signor Merzario
dimly guessed from the more fragmentary earlier records of
Parma, Modena, and Verona, shines out clear and well-defined
under the fuller light of these later records, and
helps us to read many a dark saying of the older times.</p>

<p>My thanks for much kind assistance in supplying me
with facts or authorities, are due to the Rev. Canonico
Pietro Tonarelli of Parma cathedral; the Rev. Vincenzo
Rossi, Priore of Settignano; Commendatore John Temple
Leader of Florence; and to my brother, the Rev. William
Miles Barnes, Rector of Monkton, who has written the
"English link" for me. Acknowledgments are also due
to Signor Alinari and Signor Brogi of Florence, and to
Signor Ongania of Venice, for permitting the use of their
photographs as illustrations.

THE GUILD OF THE COMACINE MASTERS</h3>

<p>In looking back to the great church-building era, <i>i.e.</i> to
the centuries between 1100 and 1500, do not the questions
arise in one's mind, "How did all these great and noble
buildings spring up simultaneously in all countries and all
climates?" and "How comes it that in all cases they were
similar to each other at similar times?"</p>

<p>In the twelfth century, when the Italian buildings, such
as the churches at Verona, Bergamo, Como, etc., were built
with round arches, the German Domkirchen at Bonn,
Mayence, Treves, Lubeck, Freiburg, etc.; the French
churches at Aix, Tournus, Caen, Dijon, etc.; and the
English cathedrals at Canterbury, Bristol, Chichester, St.
Bartholomew's in London&mdash;in fact, all those built at the
same time&mdash;were not only round-arched, but had an almost
identical style, and that style was Lombard.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century, when pointed arches mingled
with the round in Italy, the same mixture is found contemporaneously
in all the other countries.</p>

<p>Again in the fourteenth century, when Cologne, Strasburg,
and Magdeburg cathedrals were built in pure
Gothic; then those of Westminster, York, Salisbury, etc.,
arose in England; the Domes of Milan, Assisi, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Florence in Italy; and the churches of Beauvais, Laon,
and Rouen in France. These all came, almost simultaneously,
like sister buildings with one <i>impronto</i> on
them all.</p>

<p>Is it likely that many single architects in different
countries would have had the same ideas at the same time?
Could any single architect, indeed, have designed every
detail of even one of those marvellous complex buildings?
or have executed or modelled one-tenth of the wealth of
sculpture lavished on one of those glorious cathedrals?
I think not.</p>

<p>The existence of one of these churches argues a plurality
of workers under one governing influence; the existence of
them all argues a huge universal brotherhood of architects
and sculptors with different branches in each country, and
the same aims, technique, knowledge and principles permeating
through all, while each conforms in detail to local
influences and national taste.</p>

<p>If we once realize that such a Guild must have existed,
and that under the united hands of the grand brotherhood,
the great age of church-building was endowed with monuments
which have been the glory of all ages, then much
that has been obscure in Art History becomes clear; and
what was before a marvel is now shown to be a natural
result.</p>

<p>There is another point also to be considered. The
great age of church-building flourished at a time when
other arts and commerce were but just beginning. Whence,
out of the dark ages, sprang the skill and knowledge to
build such fine and sculpturesque edifices, when other
trades were in their infancy, and civic and communal life
scarcely organized?</p>

<p>It is indeed a subject of wonder how the artists of the
early period of the rise of Art were trained. Here we
find men almost in the dark ages, who were the most splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
architects, and at the same time sculptors, painters, and
even poets. How, for instance, did Giotto, a boy taken
from the sheep-folds, learn to be a painter, sculptor, and
architect of such rank that the city of Florence chose him
to be the builder of the Campanile? Did he learn it
all from old Cimabue's frescoes, and half Byzantine
<i>tavole</i>? and how did he prove to the city that he was a
qualified architect? We find him written in the archives
as <i>Magister</i> Giotto, consequently he must have passed
through the school and <i>laborerium</i> of some guild where
every branch of the arts was taught, and have graduated
in it as a master.</p>

<p>All these things will become more and more clear as
we follow up the traces of the Comacine Guild from the
chrysalis state, in which Roman art hybernated during the
dark winter of the Middle Ages, through the grub state
of the Lombard period, to the glorious winged flights of
the full Gothic of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>And first as to the chrysalis, at little Como. The origin
of the name <i>Comacine Masters</i> has caused a great deal of
argument amongst Italian writers new and old. Some
think it merely a place-name referring to the island of
Comacina, in Lake Lario or Como; others take a wider
significance, and say it means not only the city of Como,
but all the province, which was once a Roman colony of
great extension. Others again, among whom is Grotius,
suggest that it is not a place-name at all, but comes from
the Teutonic word <i>Gemachin</i> or house-builders. As the
Longobards afterwards called them in Italian <i>Maestri
Casarii</i>, which means the same thing, there is perhaps
something to be said for this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The first to draw attention to the name <i>Magistri
Comacini</i>, was the erudite Muratori, that searcher out of
ancient MSS., who unearthed from the archives an edict,
dated November 22, 643, signed by King Rotharis, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
are included two clauses treating of the <i>Magistri Comacini</i>
and their colleagues. The two clauses, Nos. 143 and
144, out of the 388 inscribed in crabbed Latin, are, when
anglicized, to the following intent&mdash;</p>

<p>"Art. 143. Of the <i>Magister Comacinus</i>. If the
Comacine Master with his <i>colliganti</i> (colleagues) shall have
contracted to restore or build the house of any person
whatsoever, the contract for payment being made, and it
chances that some one shall die by the fall of the said house,
or any material or stones from it, the owner of the said
house shall not be cited by the <i>Magister Comacinus</i> or his
brethren to compensate them for homicide or injury; because
having for their own gain contracted for the payment
of the building, they must sustain the risks and injuries
thereof."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"Art. 144. Of the engaging or hiring of <i>Magistri</i>.
If any person has engaged or hired one or more of the
Comacine Masters to design a work (<i>conduxerit ad operam
dictandum</i>), or to daily assist his workmen in building a
palace or a house, and it should happen that by reason of
the house some Comacine should be killed, the owner of
the house is not considered responsible; but if a pole or a
stone shall kill or injure any extraneous person, the Master
builder shall not bear the blame, but the person who hired
him shall make compensation."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>These laws prove that in the seventh century the
<i>Magistri Comacini</i> were a compact and powerful guild,
capable of asserting their rights, and that the guild
was properly organized, having degrees of different ranks;
that the higher orders were entitled <i>Magistri</i>, and could
"design" or "undertake" a work;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> act as architects;
and that the <i>colligantes</i> worked under, or with, them. In
fact, a powerful organization altogether;&mdash;so powerful and
so solid, that it speaks of a very ancient foundation.</p>

<p>But when and how did it originate?</p>

<p>Was it a surviving branch of the Roman <i>Collegium</i>? a
decadent group of Byzantine artists stranded in Italy? or
was it of older Eastern origin? A clever logician could
prove it to be all three.</p>

<p>For the Roman theory, he could base his arguments on
the Latin nomenclature of officials, and the Latin form of
the churches.</p>

<p>For the Byzantine theory, he would have the style of
certain ornamentations, and the assertions of German
writers, such as Müller, and Stieglitz.</p>

<p>For the ancient Eastern theory, he might plead their
Hebrew and Oriental symbolism.</p>

<p>We will take the Byzantine theory first. Müller (<i>Archaeologie
der Kunst</i>, p. 224) says that: "From Constantinople
as the centre of mechanical skill, a knowledge of art radiated
to distant countries, corporations of builders of Grecian birth
were permitted to exercise a judicial government among
themselves according to the laws of the country to which
they owed allegiance;" and Stieglitz, in his <i>History of
Architecture</i>, records a <i>tradition</i> that at the time the
Lombards were in possession of Northern Italy, <i>i.e.</i> from
the sixth to the eighth century, the Byzantine builders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
formed themselves into guilds and associations, and that on
account of having received from the Popes the privilege of
living according to their own laws and ordinances, they were
called Freemasons.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Italian and Latin writers, however,
place the advent of these Greek artists at a later period;
they are supposed to have been sculptors, who, rebelling
against the strict Iconoclasm of Leo, the Isaurian&mdash;718
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> to 741&mdash;came over to Italy where art was more
free, and joined the <i>Collegia</i> there.</p>

<p>But at this time most of the chief Longobardic churches
were already built by the Comacine Masters, and were
Roman in form, mediæval in ornamentation, and full of
ancient symbolism. Herr Stieglitz must have pre-dated his
tradition. Besides this I can find no sign in Italian buildings,
or writers about them, of any lasting Byzantine
influence. Indeed pure Byzantine architecture in Italy
seems sporadic and isolated, not only in regard to site, but
in regard to time. The Ravenna mosaics, a few in Rome,
a little work in Venice, is all one can call absolutely Byzantine;
and the influence never spread far. The Comacine
ornamentation indeed has qualities utterly distinct in spirit,
though in some of its forms allied to Byzantine. It is
possible that some of these Eastern exiles joined the Comacine
Guild, but there is quite enough in the communications
of Como with the Greeks, to account for their having imbibed
as much as they did of Byzantine style. Some of
the Bishops who were rulers of Como before and after
Lombard times were Greeks; notably Amantius the fourth,
who was translated there from Thessalonica, and his successor,
S. Abbondio. Also through the Patriarch of
Aquileja, under whose jurisdiction they were brought later,
the guild was put into contact with the Greek sculptors
then at Venice, Grado, and Ravenna.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Comacine Panel from the Church of San Clemente, Rome. The Lattice-work is made of a

</div>

<p>We will leave the Oriental theory aside as too vague and
traditional for proof, depending as it does on a few Oriental
symbols, and certain forms of decoration, and will look nearer
home&mdash;even to Rome, with which a connection may certainly
be found, and that in a form visible to our modern eyes.</p>

<p>Rome is almost as full of remains of what is now styled
Comacine architecture, as it is of classic and pagan ruins,
and they are nearly as deeply buried. Go where you will,
and in the vestibules or crypts of churches, now of gaudy
Renaissance style, you will find the sign and seal of the
ancient guild. Investigate any church which has a Lombard
tower&mdash;and they are many&mdash;and you will discover that the
hands which built that many-windowed tower have left
their mark on the church. In that wonderful third-century
basilica, which was discovered beneath the thirteenth-century
one of S. Clemente; in the almost subterranean
basilica of <i>S. Agnese fuori le mura</i>; in the vestibule of the
florid modern SS. Apostoli; in Santa Maria in Cosmedin;
and various other buildings, are wonderful old slabs of marble
with complicated Comacine knots on them. Our illustration
is from a slab in San Clemente, which was evidently from
the buried church, though used as a panel in the parapet of
the existing choir. A marvellous piece of basket-work in
marble, which, if studied, will be found composed of a single
cord, twined and intertwined. An almost identical panel is
preserved in the wall of the staircase to S. Agnese, another
has just been found reversed, and the back of it used for
the thirteenth-century mosaic decoration of the pulpit in
S. Maria in Cosmedin.</p>

<p>Then in the later Lombard churches of S. Lorenzo in
Lucina, SS. Giovanni e Paolo, S. John Lateran, etc., one
may see the crouching Comacine lions, now mostly minus
their pillars, and shoved under square door-lintels, or built
into walls, where they remain to tell of the ancient builders
whose sign and seal they were.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>And here and there we get a name.</p>

<p>In the vestibule of the SS. Apostoli is a red marble
lion, on the base of which in Gothic letters is the name
BASSALECTI. Beneath it is an old inscription, "Opus
magister Bassalecti Marmorari Romano sec, XIII." This
same Magister's name, spelt <i>Vassalecti</i>, has lately been
discovered inscribed on the capitals of some columns in
the nave of S. John Lateran.</p>

<p>In the under church of S. Clemente, an ancient fresco of
the eighth century takes us further back than this. Here we
see a veritable Roman <i>Magister</i> directing his men. He stands
in magisterial toga (and surely one may descry a masonic
apron beneath it!), directing his men in the moving of a
marble column, and with the naïve simplicity of the primitive
artist each man's name is written beside him. Albertel
and Cosmaris are dragging up the column with a rope, the
sons of Pute, who are possibly novices, are helping them,
while Carvoncelle is lifting it from behind with a lever.
These men are all in short jerkins, but the master, Sisinius,
is standing in his toga, directing them with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>Here is the Magister of a Roman <i>Collegium</i> embalmed
and preserved for us, that we may see him and his men at
work as they were in the early centuries after Christ. We
know that Masonic <i>Collegia</i> were still existing in Rome in
the time of Constantine and Theodosius; we know that
Constantine built the basilica of S. Agnese, afterwards
restored by Pope Symmachus; also those of S. Lorenzo&mdash;at
least the round-arched part of it&mdash;enlarged by Galla
Placidia in the fifth century; S. Paolo <i>fuori le Mura</i>, and
other ancient churches. We see from remains recently
brought to light, that these were originally of the exact plan
of the churches built "in the Roman manner" at Hexham
and York in England, and of the Ravenna churches, and
S. Pietro in Grado at Pisa, also nearly contemporary. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
further realize that all of these were identical in style with
the finer specimens of Lombard building some centuries
later. There is only the natural decline of art which would
have taken place in the century or two of barbarian invasion,
between the two epochs, but the traditionary forms,
methods, etc., are all reproduced in the Lombard-Comacine
churches. Compare the fourth-century door of the church
of S. Marcello at Capua with the eighth-century one of S.
Michele at Pavia, and you will find precisely the same style
of art. Compare the Roman capitals of the church of Santa
Costanza, built by Constantine, with the capitals in any
Comacine church up to 1200, and you will see the same
mixture of Ionic and a species of Corinthian with upstanding
volutes. Some of the Comacine buildings have these
upright volutes plain instead of foliaged. The effect is rude,
but I think these plainer capitals were not a sign of
incapacity in the architects of the guild, for one sees
richly ornate ones on the same building. It was only the
stock design of the inferior masters, when funds did not
allow of payment for richer work.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_029" id="i_029"></a>
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="362" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Frescoes in the Subterranean Church of San Clemente, Rome. Upper line, Byzantine,

</div>
<p>Therefore it may be inferred: (1) That architects of the
same guild worked in Rome and in Ravenna in the early
centuries after Christ; (2) that though the architects were
Roman, the decorators up to the fourth century were
chiefly Byzantine, or had imbibed that style as their paintings
show; (3) that in the time when Rome lay a heap of
ruins under the barbarians, <i>the Collegium</i>, or <i>a Collegium</i>, I
know not which, fled to independent Como; and there in
after centuries they were employed by the Longobards, and
ended in again becoming a powerful guild.</p>

<p>Hope, the author of an historical Essay on Architecture,
had a keen prevision of this guild, although he had no
documents or archives, but only the testimony of old
stones and buildings to prove it. After sketching the
formation of the Roman <i>Collegia</i>, and the employment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
their members as Christian architects under the early Popes,
he says "that a number of these, finding their work in Rome
gone in the times of invasion, banded together to do such
work in other parts of the world." He seems to think that
the nucleus of this union was Lombardy, where the superiority
of the architecture, under the Lombard kings, was such
that the term <i>Magistri Comacini</i> became almost a generic
name for architects. He says that builders and sculptors
formed a single grand fraternity, whose scope was to find
work outside Italy. Indeed distance and obstacles were
nothing to them; they travelled to England under Augustine,
to Germany with St. Boniface, to France with Charlemagne,
and again to Germany with their brother <i>magister</i>,
Albertus Magnus; they went to the east under the Eastern
Emperors, to the south under the Lombard Dukes, and in
fact are found everywhere through many centuries. The
Popes, one after another, gave them privileges. Indeed the
builders may be considered an army of artisans working in
the interest of the Popes, in all places where the missionaries
who preceded them had prepared the ground for them.</p>

<p>Diplomas and papal bulls confirmed to the guild the
privileges they had obtained under their national sovereigns,
and besides guaranteed their safety in every Catholic country
which they visited for the scope of their association. They
assumed the right to depend wholly and solely on the Pope,
which absolved them from the observance of all local laws
and statutes, royal edicts, and municipal regulations, and
released them from servitude, as well as all other obligations
imposed on the people of the country. They had not only
the power of fixing their own <i>honorarium</i>, but the exclusive
right of regulating in their own lodges everything that
appertained to their own internal government. Those
diplomas and bulls prohibited any other artist, extraneous to
the guild, from establishing any kind of competition with
them.... Encouraged by such a special protection, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Romans in great numbers entered the Masonic Guild,
particularly when they were destined to accompany the
missionaries sent by the Pope to countries hitherto unvisited
by them. The Greeks also did not delay to take part.
The Exarchate of Ravenna, first detached from the Greek
Empire by the power of the Lombard princes, had by King
Pepin been given to the Popes.... The commercial
relations and communications of all kinds maintained with
Constantinople by the many cities of Northern Italy, daily
attracted many Greeks to this city; finally, the political
turbulence of Constantinople, and chiefly the fanaticism of
the Iconoclasts, continued to associate Greek artists with
Italy, and many of these were received in the lodges,
whose number constantly increased.</p>

</div>

<p>As civilization became more diffused, the inhabitants of
northern countries, French, Germans, Belgians, and English,
were admitted to form part of these guilds. Without this
concession they would probably have had to fear a perilous
competition, encouraged by the sovereigns of other countries....
These corporations were always in league with the
Church, which in those times of war and constant struggle,
of military service and feudal slavery, was the only asylum
for those who wished to cultivate the arts of peace. Therefore
we see ecclesiastics of high rank, abbots, prelates,
bishops, exalting the respect in which the Freemasons were
held, by joining the guild as members. They gave designs
for their own churches, overlooked the building, and
employed their own monks in the manual labour.</p>

<p>Such is broadly the substance of Hope's account of
the great Lombard Guild. It shows remarkable insight,
for when he wrote, the documentary evidences which have
lately been collected were wanting.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It also explains precisely
the close connection with monks and the Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
which appears in all the story of the guild, and it accounts
for the Greek influence in the ornamentation.</p>

<p>In all the course of the history of building we see that
each country or province had to obtain its architects from
this <i>Collegium</i> at Rome, as Villani says all the cities of Italy
did, and were obliged to apply to the Grand Master of the
whole guild. Thus the early Popes had to beg architects
for Rome from the Lombard kings; Pope Adrian had to
apply to Charlemagne for builders; and so on up to the
time when all the church-building Communes had to seek
architects from some existing lodge.</p>

<p>Giovanni Villani shows us the intimate connection of
the Roman <i>Collegium</i> with Florence. He says that after
Cæsar had destroyed Fiesole he wished to build another
city to be called Cesaria, but the Senate would not permit
this. The Senate, however, gave his Generals Macrinus,
Albinus, Cneus Pompey, and Martius equal power to
build, and between them they founded Florence, bringing
the water from Monte Morello by an aqueduct. Villani
says the <i>Magistri</i> came from Rome for all these works.
That was in the days when the great masonic company had
their Grand Lodge in Rome, before the martyrdom of the
<i>Santi Quattro</i>, afterwards their patron saints.</p>

<p>In Chapter XLII. Villani relates how when the citizens
of Florence wished to build a temple to Mars, they sent to
the Senate of Rome to beg that they would supply the
most capable and clever <i>Magistri</i> that Rome could furnish.
This was done,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the Baptistery was erected in its
first form.</p>

<p>Again whilst Charlemagne and Pope Adrian were
employing the Comacines to rebuild the ruins of Rome,
we find from Villani (lib. iii. chap. 1) that Charlemagne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
sent some Romans with "all the masters there were in
Rome" (e vennero con quanti maestri n'avea in Roma per
più tosto murarla) to fortify Florence, which had appealed
to him for succour against the Fiesolans. In this manner,
says Villani, "the <i>Magistri</i> who came with the Romans
began to rebuild our noble city of Florence."</p>

<p>As early as the fifth century Cassiodorus seems to refer
to the work of the Comacines when writing about the
"public architects"&mdash;the very expression implies a public
company&mdash;and admiring the grand Italian edifices with
their "airy columns, slight as canes," he adds, "to be called
<i>Magister</i> is an honour to be coveted, for the word always
stands for great skill."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>This brings us to the question of the Latin nomenclature.
No really qualified Comacine architect is ever mentioned
either in sculptured inscription, parchment deed, or in the
registers of the lodges, without the prefix <i>Magister</i>, a title
which Cassiodorus, for one, respected. It was not a term
applied indiscriminately to all builders, like <i>murarius</i>;
and we find that the subordinate ranks of stone-cutters or
masons were called by the generic name of <i>operarius</i>. I
take it that the word, as applied to the higher rank of
the Comacine Guild, has the same value as the title of
<i>Master</i> in the old trade guilds of London, <i>i.e.</i> one who
has passed through the lower rank of the schools and
laborerium, and has by his completed education risen to the
stage of perfection, when he may teach others.</p>

<p>Morrona<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> gives the same definition. Judging from
ancient inscriptions and documents, he says that "operator"
(Latin <i>operarius</i>) is used for one who works materially;
while <i>Magister</i> signifies the architect who designs and
commands. When a <i>Magister</i> carries out his own designs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
he is said to be <i>operator ipse magister</i>, as in the case of
Magister Rainaldus, who designed and sculptured the façade
of the Duomo at Pisa.</p>

<p>In warlike times such as the Middle Ages, the only
means by which artisans could protect their interests was
by mutual protection, and hence the necessity and origin of
Trade Guilds in general. The Masonic one appears to
have been a universal fraternity with an earlier origin;
indeed many of their symbols point to a very ancient Eastern
derivation, and it is probable it was the prototype of all
other guilds.</p>

<p>Since I began writing this chapter a curious chance
has brought into my hands an old Italian book on the
institutions, rites, and ceremonies of the order of Freemasons.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Of course the anonymous writer begins with
Adoniram, the architect of Solomon's Temple, who had so
very many workmen to pay, that not being able to distinguish
them by name, he divided them into three different
classes, <i>novices</i>, <i>operatori</i>, and <i>magistri</i>, and to each class
gave a secret set of signs and passwords, so that from these
their fees could be easily fixed, and imposture avoided. It
is interesting to know that precisely the same divisions and
classes existed in the Roman <i>Collegium</i> and the Comacine
Guild&mdash;and that, as in Solomon's time, the great symbols of
the order were the endless knot, or Solomon's knot, and
the "Lion of Judah."</p>

<p>Our author goes on to tell of the second revival of Freemasonry,
in its present entirely spiritual significance, and he
gives Oliver Cromwell, of all people, the credit of this
revival! The rites and ceremonies he describes are the
greatest tissue of mediæval superstition, child's play, blood-curdling
oaths, and mysterious secrecy with nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
conceal, that can be imagined. All the signs of masonry
without a figment of reality; every moral thing masquerades
under an architectural aspect, in that "Temple made without
hands" which is figured by a Freemasons' lodge in
these days. But the significant point is that all these
names and masonic emblems point to something real which
existed at some long-past time, <i>and, as far as regards the
organization and nomenclature, we find the whole thing in
its vital and actual working form in the Comacine Guild</i>.
Our nameless Italian who reveals all the Masonic secrets,
tells us that every lodge has three divisions, one for the
novices, one for the <i>operatori</i> or working brethren, and one
for the masters, besides a meeting or recreation room; and
that no lodge can be established without a minimum of two
masters. Now wherever we find the Comacines at work,
we find the threefold organization of <i>schola</i> or school for
the novices, <i>laborerium</i> for the <i>operatori</i>, and the <i>Opera</i>
or <i>Fabbrica</i> for the Masters of Administration.</p>

<p>The anonymous one tells us that there is a <i>Gran
Maestro</i> or <i>Arch-magister</i> at the head of the whole order,
a <i>Capo Maestro</i> or chief Master at the head of each
lodge. Every lodge must besides be provided with two
or four <i>Soprastanti</i>, a treasurer, and a secretary-general,
besides accountants. This is precisely what we find in the
organization of the Comacine Lodges. As we follow them
through the centuries we shall see it appearing in city after
city, at first dimly shadowed where documents are wanting,
but at last fully revealed by the books of the treasurers and
<i>Soprastanti</i> themselves, in Siena, Florence, and Milan.</p>

<p>Thus, though there is no certain proof that the
Comacines were the veritable stock from which the pseudo-Freemasonry
of the present day sprang, we may at least
admit that they were a link between the classic <i>Collegia</i>
and all other art and trade guilds of the Middle Ages. They
were called Freemasons because they were builders of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
privileged class, absolved from taxes and servitude, and free
to travel about in times of feudal bondage. The term was
applied to them both in England and Germany. Findel
quotes two old English MSS., one of 1212, where the
words "<i>sculptores lapidum liberorum</i>" are in close conjunction
with <i>c&oelig;mentari</i>, which is the oldest Latin form for
builder; and another dated 1396, where occurs the phrase
"<i>latomos vocatos fremaceons</i>." In the rolls of the building
of Exeter and Canterbury cathedrals the word <i>Freimur</i> is
frequent, and no better proof can be given of the way the
early Masonic guild came into England. The Italian term
<i>liberi muratori</i> went into Germany with the Comacine
Masters, who built Lombard buildings in many a German
city, before Gothic ones were known; thence it passed
Teutonized as <i>Freimur</i> into England.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>Cesare Cantù (<i>Storia di Como</i>, vol. i. p. 440) thus
describes the Guild&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our Como architects certainly gave the name to the
Masonic companies, which, I believe, had their origin at
this time, though some claim to derive them from Solomon.
These were called together in the <i>Loggie</i> (hence Lodge)
by a grand-master to treat of affairs common to the order,
to accept novices, and confer superior degrees on others.
The chief Lodge had other dependencies, and all members
were instructed in their duties to the Society, and taught to
direct every action to the glory of the Lord and His
worship; to live faithful to God and the Government; to
lend themselves to the public good and fraternal charity.
In the dark times which were slowly becoming enlightened,
they communicated to each other ideas on architecture,
buildings, stone-cutting, the choice of materials and good
taste in design. Strength, force, and beauty were their
symbols. Bishops, princes, men of high rank who studied
architecture fraternized with them, but the mixture of so
many different classes changed in time the spirit of the
Freemasons. The original forms of building were lost
when the science fell into the hands and caprice of venal
artisans."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>We shall see the way in which the Comacines spread
fraternity wherever they went. When they began building
in any new place, they generally founded a lodge there,
which comprised a <i>laborerium</i> and school. Thus we find
one under the Antellami family in Parma before 1200,
and not long after one in Modena under the same masters
from Campione. The lodge is clearly defined at Orvieto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and Siena. In Lucca there was a <i>laborerium</i> before the
year 1000. In 1332 it had obtained privileges. At Milan
there was evidently another, for on February 3, 1383, the
archbishop invites the architects <i>Fratelli</i> (brethren), and
others who understand the work, to inspect the models for
the cathedral; now these words evidently refer to a
Masonic brotherhood, as does the term <i>Opera Magiestatem</i>
so often met with in old documents.</p>

<p>In the Marches of Ancona is a sepulchre inscribed
to the <i>fratres Comacini</i>, and in the Abruzzi are chapels
dedicated by them. In Rome it is recorded that they met
in the church of SS. Quattro Coronati. These patron
saints of the guild, the four holy crowned ones (Santi
Quattro Coronati), strike me as having a peculiar significance
in regard to their origin. We are told that during
the persecutions under Diocletian, four brethren, named
Nicostratus, Claudius, Castorio, and Superian<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (either
brothers, or more likely members of the same <i>Collegium</i>),
who were famous for their skill in building and sculpture,
refused to exercise their art for the pagan Emperor. "We
cannot," they said, "build a temple for false gods, nor
shape images in wood or stone to ensnare the souls of
others." They were all martyred in different ways: one
scourged, one shut up and tortured in an iron case, one
thrown into the sea; the other was decapitated. Their
relics were in the time of St. Leo placed in four urns, and
deposited in the crypt of the church, which was built to
their honour, in the time of Honorius, by the Comacines
then in Rome. It has always been the especial church of
the guild, and their meeting-place. They had an altar
dedicated to the same saints at Siena, and another at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Venice. We find from the statutes of the Sienese guild as
late as the fourteenth century, that the <i>fête</i> of the "Quattro"
was kept in a special manner by the Masonic guild. All
the Church <i>fêtes</i> are classed together as days when no work
is to be done, but the day of the SS. Quattro has two laws
all to itself, and is kept with peculiar ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On the altar of this church on Mount Aventine are
silver busts of the four Magister martyrs; and on the wall
is an ancient inscription, as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>If I interpret the abbreviations <span class="smcap">M&#862;R. F&#862;RM</span> and <span class="smcap">FA&#862;ML</span> aright,
this inscription would imply that members of each of the
three grades of the Roman Masonic guild, Magister,
Fratres, and Famuli (apprentices), were martyred together,
and their remains placed in this church with the relics of
some proto-martyrs. The <i>Magistri</i> were afterwards canonized,
and the four I have named became the patron saints
of the guild. S. Carpophorus was held in special veneration
in Como, of which place he was probably a native, or else
a Greek member of the Comacine Lodge there.</p>

<p>The other side of the inscription chronicles the restoration
of the altar which was ruined and broken down, in the
time of Pope Paschalis Secundus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1111, in the fourth
Indiction.</p>

<p>The church of the SS. Quattro has remains of a fine
atrium or portico. In the wall of the atrium is a fragment
of <i>intreccio</i>. The original form of the church is well
preserved, and is identical with that of S. Agnese,
<i>fuori le mura</i>. The gallery for the women is well
preserved.</p>

<p>The especial veneration for the four crowned martyrs
seems to point to their Roman origin, and to specify the
reason why the remnant of the particular <i>Collegium</i> to
which they belonged fled from Rome, and took refuge
in the safe little republic of Como, so that it was not
only the Goths and Vandals from whom they fled. It
explains also the intense religion in their work, and rules;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the very first principles of which were to respect God's
name, and do all to His glory.</p>

<p>It need not excite wonder that any guild should have
fled from Rome in these centuries. This was the time
that Gregory the Great, painted so graphically in his
passionate Homily of Ezechiel, preached at Rome.
"Everywhere see we mourning, hear we laments; cities,
strongholds, villages are devastated; the earth is a desert.
No busy peasants are in the fields, few people in the
cities, and these last relics of human kind daily suffer new
wounds. There is no end to the scourging of God's
judgment.... We see some carried into slavery, others
cruelly mutilated, and yet more killed. What joy, oh my
brethren, is left to us in life? If it is still dear to us we
must look for wounds, and not for pleasures. Behold
Rome, once Queen of the world, to what is she reduced?&mdash;prostrated
by the sorrows and desolation of her citizens,
by the fierceness of her enemies and frequent ruin, the
prophecy against Samaria has been fulfilled in her. Here
no longer have we a senate; the people are perished, save
the few who still suffer daily. Rome is empty, and has
barely escaped the flames; her buildings are thrown down.
The fate of Nineveh is already upon her...."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Longobard invaders were more merciful than the
Goths, for not long after their rule was over, another Pope
wrote to Pepin&mdash;"Erat sanæ hoc mirabile in regno
Longobardorum, nulla erat violenta nulla struebantur
insidiæ. Nemo aliquem iniuste angariabat, nemo spoliabat.
Non erat furta, non latrocinia, unusquisque quodlibebat
securus sine timore pergebat."&mdash;<i>Histor. Franc. Scrip.</i> Tom.
III. cap. xvi.</p>

<p>Whatever the moving cause, the fact remains that in
the Middle Ages the Comacine Masters had a nucleus on
that strong little fortified island of Comacina, which, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
with Como itself, stood against the Lombards in the
sixth century for twenty years before being subjugated;
and in the twelfth, held its own independence for a quarter
of a century against Milan and the Lombard League, which
it refused to join.</p>

<p>When at length the Longobards became their rulers,
they respected their art and privileges. The guild remained
free as it had been before, and in this freedom its power
must have increased fast.</p>

<p>The Masters worked liberally for their new lords, but it
was as paid architects, not as serfs. As a proof we may
cite an edict signed by King Luitprand on February 28,
713. It is entitled <i>Memoratorio</i>, and is published by
Troya in his <i>Codex Diplomaticus Longobardus</i>.</p>

<p>It fixes the prices of every kind of building. Here are
the titles of the seven clauses, referring to the payments
of the <i>Magistri Comacini</i>: <i>De Mercede Comacinorum</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="s08">CLVII.</span> Capit. i. De Sala. "Si sala fecerit, etc."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>The Longobard rule explains why the Comacine Masters
of the thirteenth century were known as Lombards, and
the architecture of that time as the "Lombard style."
In the same way they were called <i>Franchi</i> when Charlemagne
was their king; and <i>Tedeschi</i> when the German
dynasty conquered North Italy; if indeed the words <i>artefici
Franchi</i> do not merely signify Freemasons, which I strongly
suspect is the true meaning.</p>

<p>To understand the connection of this guild of architects
with little Como we must glance backwards at the state
of that province under the Romans, when it was a colony
ruled by a prefect. Junius Brutus himself was one of
these rulers, and Pliny the Younger a later one. At this
time Como was a large and flourishing city. It had in
Cæsar's time a theatre whose ruins were found near S.
Fedele; a gymnasium for the games, which was near the
present church of Santa Chiara. A document dated 1500
speaks of the Arena of Como as then still existing. The
<i>campus martius</i> was at S. Carpoforo, where several Roman
inscriptions, urns, and medals were found. This valuable
collection of Latin inscriptions, found in and about Como,
proves the successive rule of emperors, prefects, military
tribunes, naval prefects, Decurions, etc. We have records
also of Senators, Decemviri, and other municipal magistrates.
The inscriptions also show that there were temples to
Jove, Neptune, the <i>Dea Bona</i>, the Manes, the <i>Dea
Mater</i>, Silvanus, Æsculapius, Mars, Diana, Hygeia, and
even Isis.</p>

<p>Some Cippi are dedicated to Mercury and Hercules;
and one found near S. Maria di Nullate was inscribed by
order of the Comacines to <i>Fortuna Obsequente</i>, "for the
health of the citizens." To this day a <i>Prato Pagano</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
(pagan field) exists near Como. All these proofs, together
with Pliny's testimony, go to show that Como was in
Roman times an important centre, and as such was likely
to have its own <i>Collegia</i> or trade guilds, to one of which
probably Pliny's builder, Mustio, belonged, and to which
the Roman refugees naturally fled as brethren.</p>

<p>Pliny the Younger at that time lived at Como, in his
delightful villa, <i>Comedia</i>. In his grounds, on a high hill,
were the ruins of the temple of the Eleusinian Ceres,
and he determined to restore this temple, as devotees
flocked there during the Ides of September, and had no
refuge from sun or rain.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> His letter to "Mustio," a Comacine
architect, gives the commission for this restoration,
and after explaining the form he wished the design to
take, he concludes&mdash;"At least unless you think of something
better, you, whose art can always overcome difficulties
of position." For Pliny, fresh from Rome, to give
such praise to an architect at Como, shows that even at
that time good masters existed there.</p>

<p>Another letter of Pliny's (Lib. X. Epist. xlii.) speaks of
the villa of his friend Caninus Rufus, on the same lake,
with its beautiful porticoes and baths, etc., and of the many
other villas, palaces, temples, forums, etc., which embellished
Como and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Catullus lived here when the poet Cæcilius, whose works
have now perished, invited him to leave the hills of Como,
and the shores of Lario, to join him in Verona.</p>

<p>Pliny seems to confirm the existence of guilds,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as he
speaks of the institution of a <i>Collegium</i> of iron-workers,
who wished to be patented by the Emperor, but Trajan
refused to form new guilds, for fear of the <i>Hetæriæ</i> or
factions which might infiltrate into them.</p>

<p>Mommsen, in his work <i>De Collegiis et Sodalitiis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Romanorum</i>, says that under the emperors no guild was
allowed to hold meetings, except by special laws, yet
though new companies were not to be formed, the existing
ones of architects and artisans were permitted to continue
after public liberty was lost. Several documents prove
that the chief scope of these unions was to promote the
interests of their art, to provide mutual assistance in the
time of need, to succour the sick and poor, and to bury
the dead.</p>

<p>The trade guilds in London, the <i>Arti</i> in Florence, and
the town clubs kept up in England till lately, seem to be
all survivals of these ancient classical societies.</p>

<p>Besides the Builders' Society, Como had, in Roman
times, a nautical guild. An inscription is extant, dedicated
to C. Messius Fortunatus by the <i>Collegium nautarum
Comensium</i>. This guild sent twenty ships of war to
Venice in Barbarossa's time.</p>

<p>But besides having privileged societies, Como and its
Comacine islands were a privileged territory, and might
almost have been called a republic. We have, it is true,
no documentary evidence of this dating back to pre-Longobardic
times, but as Otho in 962<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> confirmed the islands in
all former privileges granted by his predecessors on the
Imperial throne, we may fairly suppose the privileges dated
from times far anterior to himself.</p>

<p>This is an anglicized version of his decree, which was
granted on the petition of the Empress Adelaide&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the name of the Holy and indivisible Trinity,
Otho, by the will of God, august Emperor. If we incline
to the demands of our faithful people, much more should
we lend our ear to the prayers of our beloved consort.
Know then, all ye faithful subjects of the Holy Church of
God, present and future, that the august Empress Adelaide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
our wife, invokes our clemency, that for her sake we
receive under our protection the inhabitants of the Comacine
islands, and surrounding places known as Menasie
(<i>sic</i>), and we confirm all the privileges which they have
enjoyed under our predecessors, and under ourselves before
we were anointed Emperor, viz. they shall not be called
on for military service, nor have <i>arbergario</i> (taxes on roads
and bridges), nor pay <i>curatura</i> (tax on beasts), <i>terratico</i>
(tax on land), <i>ripatico</i> (on ships), or the <i>decimazione</i> (tax
on householders) of our kingdom, neither shall they be
obliged to serve in our councils, except the general assembly
at Milan, which they shall attend three times a year. All
this we concede, etc. Given on the 8th before the calends
of September, in the year of the Incarnation 962, first year of
the reign of the most pious Otho."&mdash;<i>Indiction V. in Como.</i></p>

<p>The hypothesis that this decree refers to a long-existing
liberty is confirmed by the history of Como in the time
of Justinian I. Up to the middle of the sixth century a
certain Imperial Governor of Insubria, named Francione,
who had seen Rome sacked and his own state taken, fled
to Comacina as a free place of refuge when Alboin invaded
Italy. He helped the Comacines to hold out against the
barbarians for more than twenty years, and so secure was
the place considered that the island was by Narses and
others made the depositary of infinite treasures. With him
multitudes of Romans had taken refuge there, but finally
even this fell into the hands of the Longobards. We
are told that Autharis subjugated Istria, and after a six
months' siege, possessed himself of the very strongly fortified
island of Comacina on the lake of Como, where he
found immense treasures, doubtless part of the traditional
wealth amassed by Narses, and which as well as much
private property had been deposited here for security by
the neighbouring peoples.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Here then, four centuries before Otho's decree, we have
Comacina as a place of refuge in troublous times, chosen
because, being a free city, it was considered more safe than
other towns. We need not then consider it improbable, if
in the dark centuries when the Roman Empire was dying
out, and its glorious temples and streets falling into ruin
under the successive inroads of half-savage despoilers;
when the arts and sciences were falling into disuse or being
enslaved; and when no place was safe from persecution
and warfare, the guild of the Architects should fly for safety
to almost the only free spot in Italy; and here, though they
could no longer practise their craft, they preserved the
legendary knowledge and precepts which, as history implies,
came down to them through Vitruvius from older
sources, some say from Solomon's builders themselves.</p>

<p>Among the treasures must have been works of Greek
and Roman art, that kept alive the old spirit among the
guild of builders gathered there; but alas! after the long
generations when art was decaying, and uncalled for, their
hands lost their skill, they could no longer reproduce the
perfect works.</p>

<p>It was here the Longobards found them, and in their
new Christian zeal soon furnished them with work enough.

<p>It was on April 2, 568, that the Longobards under
Alboin, with their wives and children and with all their
belongings, "<i>colle loro mogli e figli, e con tutte le sostanze
loro</i>," first came down and took Friuli. Alboin gave the
government there to Gisulph, his nephew, leaving with him
many of the chief and bravest families, and a high-bred
race of horses (<i>generosa razza di cavalli</i>).</p>

<p>Next he took Vicenza and Verona, and in September
569 passed into Liguria&mdash;which then extended from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Adda to the Ligurian Sea,&mdash;and conquered Milan. To
this add Emilia, and later, Ravenna and Tuscany, and the
first Lombard kingdom was complete.</p>

<p>From this kingdom depended the three dukedoms of
Friuli, Spoleto, and Beneventum. The last was added in
the time of Autharis (575-591) when, like Canute, he
rode into the sea at Reggio in Calabria, and touching the
waves with his lance, cried&mdash;"These alone shall be the
boundary of the Longobards."<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>This Autharis married Theodolinda, a Christian. He
was an Arian, but by her means he became Catholic. After
his death, in 590, she chose Agilulf, who reigned with her
twenty-five years.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Paulus Diaconus gives the following very pretty account
of Theodolinda's two betrothals&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was expedient for Autharis, the young King of the
Lombards, to take a wife, and an ambassador was sent to
Garibald, King of Bavaria, to propose an alliance with his
daughter Theodolinda. Autharis disguised himself as
one of the suite, with the object of seeing beforehand what
his bride was like. She was sent for by her father and bidden
to hand some wine to the guests. Having served the
ambassador first, she handed the cup to Autharis, and in
giving him the serviette after drinking, he managed to press
her hand. The princess blushed, and told the incident to
her nurse, who in a prophetic manner assured her that he
must be the king himself, or he would not have dared
to touch her.</p>

<p>"Soon after, on the Franks invading Bavaria, Theodolinda
with her brother fled to Italy, where Autharis met her
near Verona, and the marriage was solemnized on the Ides
of May, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 589.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"Amongst the guests were Agilulf, Duke of Turin, and
with him a youth of his suite, son of an augur; in a sudden
storm a tree near them was struck by lightning, on which the
young augur said to Agilulf&mdash;'The bride who has arrived
to-day will shortly wed you.' Agilulf was so angry at what
seemed a disrespect to the king and queen, that he threatened
to cut off his page's head, who replied&mdash;'I may die,
but I cannot change destiny.' And truly, when a few years
after Autharis was poisoned at Pavia, Theodolinda's people
were so attached to her, that they offered her the kingdom
if she would elect a Longobard as husband.</p>

<p>"Destiny had decreed that she should choose Agilulf.
The same ceremony of offering him a cup of wine was gone
through, and he kissed her hand as she gave it. The queen
blushing said&mdash;'He who has a right to the mouth need not
kiss the hand.' So Agilulf knew that he was her chosen
king.</p>

<p>"She was a Christian, and a favourite disciple of Gregory
the Great. Her good life and prayers were able to convert
Agilulf to orthodox Christianity, for like many Longobards
of the time he had fallen into the Arian heresy. In gratitude
for this she vowed a church to St. John Baptist, and a
miraculous voice inspired her as to the site at Mod&oelig;cia,
or '<i>oppidum moguntiaci</i>.'"</p>

<p>It was under these Christianized invaders that the
Comacine Masters became active and influential builders
again, and it is here that the actual history of the guild
begins.</p>

<p>It is apparent that what are called Lombard buildings
could not have been the work of the Longobards themselves.
Symonds realized this difficulty, but had not solved the
question as to <i>who</i> built the Lombard churches, when he
wrote<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;"The question of the genesis of the Lombard style,
is one of the most difficult in Italian art history. I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
not willingly be understood to speak of Lombard architecture
in any sense different from that in which it is usual to
speak of Norman. To suppose that either the Lombards
or the Normans had a style of their own, prior to their
occupation of districts from the monuments of which they
learned rudely to use the decayed Roman manner, would be
incorrect. Yet it seems impossible to deny that both
Normans and Lombards, in adapting antecedent models,
added something of their own, specific to themselves as
northerners. The Lombard, like the Norman, or the
Rhenish Romanesque, is the first stage in the progressive
mediæval architecture of its own district."</p>

<p>It appears possible, however, that the Longobards had
very little to do with the architecture of their era except as
patrons. Was there ever a stone Lombard building known
out of Italy before Alboin and his hordes crossed the Alps?
or even in Italy during the reigns of Alboin and Cleoph,
their first kings?</p>

<p>But there were older buildings of precisely the same
style, in Italy and in Como itself, dating from the time
when the Bishops ruled, long before the Longobards came.
There were the churches of S. Abbondio and S. Fedele.
The latter was built in Abbondio's own time, about 440-489,
and first dedicated to S. Euphemia. It was rebuilt later by
the Comacines under the Longobards, but its form was not
changed. The former, said to have been built by the
Bishop Amantius, was first dedicated to SS. Peter and
Paul, whose relics he placed here. These two are certainly
the oldest churches existing in Como.</p>

<p>Amantius the Byzantine ordained S. Abbondio, who
was a Macedonian, as his successor, and he too became
eminent in his time, and is still venerated as a patron Saint
in all the Milanese district. Pope Leo sent him to Constantinople
as his Legate, to interview the Patriarch
Anastasius, and also deputed him to form the Council with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Eusebius, at Milan. The Greek touch in the Lombard
ornamentation may be accounted for by Greek sculptors
assisting the Italian builders in the time of these Eastern
bishops.</p>

<p>But, to return to the Longobards:&mdash;it was only when the
civilization of Italy began to tell on them, and Christianity
refined their minds, that they commenced to patronize the
Arts, and revived the fading traditions of the builders'
guild into practice, for the glorification of their religious
zeal. "Little by little," says Muratori, "the barbarous
Longobards became more polished (<i>andavano disrugginendo</i>)
by taking the customs and rites of the Italians.
Many of them were converted from Arianism to Catholicism,
and they vied with the Italians in piety and liberality
towards the Church of God, building both Hospices and
Monasteries."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Comacine Masters were undoubtedly the only
architects employed by them, so we are sure that in the
Lombard churches of this era, we see the Comacine work
of the first or Roman-Lombard style.</p>

<p>Autharis and Theodolinda were the first orthodox
Christians: indeed Theodolinda, who was baptized by
Gregory the Great, and formed a special friendship with
him, became a shining light in the Church. To them is
probably due the honour of inaugurating the Renaissance of
Comacine art. Autharis, though an Arian, first employed
the Masters of the guild to build a church and monastery
at Farfa on the banks of the Adda, not far from Monza.
They have long been ruined, but ancient writers quote them
as fine and rich works of architecture. Next, Theodolinda
and her second husband, Agilulf, the succeeding king, built
the cathedral at Monza, which they resolved should be
worthy of the new creed. This cathedral was the prototype
of all the Lombard churches.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>Before proceeding further it may be well to define precisely
the difference between Eastern and Western forms
in these centuries, while they were as yet distinct.</p>

<p>As we have said, the Basilica was the type of Roman
or Western architecture, a type which passed afterwards
to the East, where the cupola was added to it.</p>

<p>The Comacine Guild, being a survival of the Roman
<i>Collegium</i>, had of course Roman traditions, and took
naturally this Roman type of the Basilica,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which form
they adapted to the uses of the Christian Church, while
its ornamentation was suited to the taste of the Longobards.</p>

<p>The Basilica, as Vitruvius explains it, was a room where
the ruler and his delegates administered justice. But when,
after the persecutions, Christians were allowed their
churches, the Basilicæ so well supplied the needs of
Christian worship, that either the ancient ones were used as
churches, or new buildings were erected in the same form;
so that by the fourth century the word Basilica was understood
to mean a church remarkable for its size, and of a set
form and grandeur, with a raised tribune. The Basilicæ
of Constantine were all dedicated to Saints&mdash;St. Peter, St.
Paul, Beato Marcellino. The Sessorian Basilica was begun
in 330, to hold the relics of the Cross, discovered by the
Empress Helena. From the time of the edict of Theodosius,
however, Christian architecture took a new and independent
character; and this was when the Basilica became amplified
and beautified.</p>

<p>The Oriental churches, on the other hand, were derived
from the antique synagogue, in which concentric forms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
either circular or polygonal, predominated. In their later
development four equal arms were added, and here we
get the Greek Cross, in the centre of which arose the
dome.</p>

<p>In the Romanesque, or Comacine style of the ninth to
the fourteenth centuries, the form becomes more complicated.
We have, 1. the sanctuary or presbytery; 2. the
apse for the choir; 3. the transepts; 4. the normal square
or centre; 5. the elongated nave; 6. the aisles; 7. the
atrium or portico.</p>

<p>In Theodolinda's time, however, church architecture
in Lombardy was wholly and purely Roman, with the
influences of mediæval Christianity. Ricci tells us that the
construction of the first churches followed a symbolical
expression. "Hermeneutic symbolism required that the
apse or choir should face the east, so that the faithful while
praying had that part before them."</p>

<p>A very usual form was the tri-apsidal church, of which
many specimens still exist. S. Pietro a Grado, near Pisa,
is a beautiful specimen of this.</p>

<p>Around the apse of a Lombard church was a portico
where the penitents and catechumens might stand, who
were not yet admitted to the altar. On high were <i>loggie</i>
(galleries) "for the virgins and women." The tribune was
elevated and often ornamented with a railing, the crypt or
confessional being beneath it. The crypt signified a
memory of the early Christians, when subterranean catacombs
formed the church of the faithful. The altar was
generally the tomb of a martyr, in fulfilment of the text&mdash;"I
saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain
for the word of God, and for the testimony which they
held" (Rev. vi. 9).</p>

<p>Where the original form of the Lombard church has
not been altered, as in the first Monza church, all these
parts may be still seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>We are expressly told by Ricci,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that for the building
of her church at Monza, Queen Theodolinda availed herself
of those <i>Magistri Comacini</i>, who, as Rotharis describes
them in his laws 143 and 144, were qualified architects and
builders.</p>

<p>It seems that even though all Italy was subjugated by
the Longobards, the <i>Magistri Comacini</i> retained their
freedom and privileges. They became Longobard citizens,
but were not serfs; they retained their power of making
free contracts, and receiving a fair price for their work,
and were even entitled to hold and dispose of landed
property.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Therefore it was by a free contract, and not in any
spirit of servitude, that the Comacines undertook the
building of Theodolinda's church.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine what the church was in Theodolinda's
time, as its form was altered in the twelfth and
fourteenth centuries. Ricci says that the antique Monza
Basilica terminated at what is now the first octagon column,
on which rest the remains of the primitive façade. Four
columns supported the arched tribune, and the high altar
was raised above the level of the church. In front was the
<i>atrium</i>, supported by porticoes, and he thinks that the
sculptures in the present façade are the old ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_063" id="i_063"></a>
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="347" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ancient Sculpture in Monza Cathedral.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_39">See page 39.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Cattaneo, the Italian authority on Lombard architecture,
does not believe in the present existence of even this much
of Theodolinda's church, and in disclaiming the façade,
disclaims also the sculpture on it, especially the one over
the door, where Agilulf and Theodolinda offer the diadem
of the cross to St. John the Baptist, and are shown as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
wearing crowns, which the early Lombard kings did not
do.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The figures have, it is true, the entire style of the
twelfth century, when later Comacines restored the church.
Cattaneo thinks that the only sculpture which can safely be
dated from Theodolinda's own time, is a stone which might
have been an altar frontal, on which is a rude relief of a
wheel circle, emblem of Eternity, flanked by two crosses
with the letters <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> hanging to the arms of
them. It is a significant fact that the Alpha is in the
precise form of the Freemason symbol of the compasses,
and in the wheel-like circle one sees the beginning of that
symbol of Eternity, the unbroken line with neither end
nor beginning, which the Comacines in after centuries developed
into such wonderful <i>intrecci</i> (interlaced work). The
sculpture is extremely rude; by way of enriching the relief,
the artist has covered the crosses and circles with drill-holes.
Now this is a most interesting link, connecting the
debased Roman art with this beginning of the Christian
art in the West (the early Ravenna sculptors do not count,
being imported from the East). On examining any of the
late Roman cameos, or <i>intagli</i>, or even their stone sculpture,
after the fall of classical art in Hadrian's time, one may
perceive the way in which the drill is constantly made use
of instead of the chisel.</p>

<p>So these Comacine artists began with the only style of
art they had been educated up to, and though retaining old
traditions they had fallen out of practice, during a century
or two, while invaders ravaged their country, and had to
begin again with low art, little skill, and unused imagination.
But with the new impulse given to art, their
skill increased, they gained a wider range of imagination,
greater breadth of design, going on century by century, as
we shall trace, from the first solid, heavy, little structures, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the airy lightness of the florid Romanesque&mdash;the marriage
of East and West.</p>

<p>Another <i>chiesa graziosissima</i>, said to have been founded
by Theodolinda, was that of Santa Maria del Tiglio, near
Gravedona, on the left bank of Lake Como, which Muratori
says was already ancient in 823, when the old chronicler
Aimoninus describes it (<i>Aimoninus de Gestis Francorum</i>,
iv. 3). It has been much altered since that time, but as
Prof. Merzario writes&mdash;"When one reflects that it was the
work of a thousand years ago, and when one considers the
lightness of design, the elegance of the arches, windows,
columns, and colonnettes, one must perforce confess that
even at that epoch Art was blossoming in the territory of
Como, under the hands of the <i>Maestri Comacini</i>."</p>

<p>Theodolinda also founded the monastery of Monte
Barro, near Galbiate; the church of S. Salvatore in Barzano,
a little mountain church at Besano above Viggiu;
that of S. Martino at Varenna; and the church, baptistery,
and castle of Perleda above it; in which latter it is said she
died. Queen Theodolinda was accustomed to spend the
hot months of summer on the banks of the lake, and a part
of the road near Perleda Castle is still called <i>Via Regina</i>
(the Queen's road), in memory of her. King Cunibert,
too, loved the banks of Como.</p>

<p>There is always some pretty, graceful reason in Theodolinda's
church-building, very different to the reasons of
many of the kings. Theirs were too often sin-offerings,
built in remorse, but hers were generally thank-offerings,
built in love. For instance, the church at Lomella, which
she erected in memory of having first met her second
husband Agilulf there.</p>

<p>Theodolinda also built a church to S. Julia at Bonate,
near Val San Martino, in the diocese of Bergamo; but in
these days not much sign is left of it. The author of the
<i>Antichità Long. Mil.</i> (Dissertation I., p. 120) says that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mario Lupo has published the plan and section of the
church in his <i>Codice diplomatico</i> (<i>T. I.</i>, p. 204), together
with another, still more magnificent, of almost the same
date. It is dedicated to S. Tommaso, and stands near the
river Brembo, at Lemine in the same diocese. "This
church," says the monk who wrote the <i>Antichità</i>, etc., "still
exists (in 1792), and is of circular form, with inferior and
superior <i>porticati</i> in the interior, recalling the design of
the ancient church of S. Vitale at Ravenna." Lupo
describes it even in its ruin as an "admirable temple,
whose equal, whether for size, solidity, or elegance, can
scarcely be found in Lombardy. Its perimeter," he says,
"may be traced among the thorns and briars of the surrounding
woods, and its form and size may thus be perceived.
The ruins confirm the assertion of the splendour
of buildings in Queen Theodolinda's time, and show that in
the beginning of the seventh century architecture was not
so rude as has been supposed, and that besides solidity of
structure, it preserved a just proportion and harmony of
parts, excepting perhaps in the extreme lightness and
inequality of the columns."</p>

<p>We read much in ancient authors of Queen Theodolinda's
palace, with its paintings on the walls, representing
Alboin and his wild hordes of Longobards, with their
many-coloured garments, loose hosen, and long beards.
We can believe that these paintings were as rude and
mediæval as their sculpture, whether they were done by
savage Longobards or decayed Romano-Comacine artists.
They prove, however, that painting was one of the branches
of art in the guild.</p>

<p>King Agilulf also employed the architects; but it was
in a more military style of architecture&mdash;to build castles
and bridges. The castle of Branigola dates from his reign,
as does the fine bridge over the Brembo, and another over
the Breggia, between Cernobbio and Borgovico, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Como. He is also accredited with the building of the
Palazzo della Torre at Turin, with its two octangular
towers, and mixed brick and stone solid architecture. In
all these works the builders, as in modern times, seem to
have sometimes lost their lives. So much so that King
Rotharis, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 636, made, as we have seen, special laws on
the subject.</p>

<p>Gundeberg, the daughter of Theodolinda, had a similar
fate to her mother in being the wife of two successive kings
(Ariold and Rotharis). She also imitated her in church-building.
The church of S. Giovanni in Borgo at Pavia,
was erected by her.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is said that after S. Michele this
was the finest building of the age. It had a nave and two
aisles, with a gallery over the arches. The apse had the
external colonnade, and practicable gallery, and the octagonal
dome. The façade, as usual, was divided into three parts,
and was rich in symbolical friezes. Half-way up the façade
was an ambulatory, on six double arches and small columns,
which communicated with the internal galleries for the
women. This was reached by two spiral stairways cut in
the pilasters of the façade. (In reading this we seem to be
reading over again the description of Hexham in England.)
The lower half of the façade was of sandstone, the upper
half of brick adorned "a cacabus," <i>i.e.</i> inlaid with various
convex plates in different-coloured smalto.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is a great
pity that this interesting church was destroyed in 1811, and
its symbolic reliefs and carved stones ruthlessly used in
the foundation of modern buildings. Some were, however,
saved by a nobleman of Pavia, Don Galeazzo Vitali, and
are preserved in his villa between Lodi and Pavia. Here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
on May 13, 1828, the Signori Sacchi<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> went to see them,
and found many valuable specimens of Comacine symbolical
art. Here are square slabs which may have been parts of
friezes or <i>plutei</i> (panels of marble), covered with interlaced
work, formed of entwining vines, or even serpents; sometimes
a simple cord in mystic and continuous knots, precisely
similar to the ones recently discovered in S. Agnese
and S. Clemente at Rome. There were several capitals of
columns and pilasters with significant grotesques, such as a
man between two lions; a maze of vines with a satyr in
them, possibly an emblem of Christianity which constrains
and civilizes even the wildest natures; two armed warriors
on horseback meeting in battle, figuring the Church militant.
(There is a similar capital in S. Stefano at Pavia.)
In one, two hippogriffs meet at the angles; in another, two
dragons with tails intertwined are biting a man between
them placed at the angle. (The same emblem of the strife
with sin is represented in S. Pietro of the "golden roof.")
One is a curious symbol which would seem to be a remnant
of paganism, and represents the fish goddess of Eastern
religions. A woman, with only a fig-leaf for dress, has a
double tail instead of legs. She holds the two ends of this
dual tail, while serpents coiling into it suck her breasts&mdash;a
very mystic conception of Eve. There is a very remarkable
round mass of stone, with a toothed circle carved on each
side, and in the circles a cross. It is said by Muratori that
this stone was placed high up over the altar so that all
worshippers should behold the cross.</p>

<p>A singular ancient Pavian custom was connected with
this church. Once a year a kind of fair was held there, at
which nothing was sold but rings, and no one was allowed
to buy them except children and unmarried women. It is
thought that the custom was begun by Gundeberg herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
in commemoration of the gift of three rings, one with a
pearl, and two with jacinth stones, from Gregory the
Great.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> His letter of congratulation to Theodolinda on
the baptism of her little son Adaloald is still existing. He
says "he sends some gifts for her boy, and three rings for
her young daughter Gundeberg." Possibly the gift of the
Pope was placed in the treasury of the church, and commemorated
at first by the sale of blessed amulets in the form of
rings, but which afterwards degenerated into a fair. The
custom lasted till 1669.</p>

<p>Industries of all kinds seem to have flourished under the
Longobards; and the Popes of Rome and other sovereigns
made frequent use of Lombard artificers. A letter from
Gregory to Arichi, Duke of Lombardy, dated 596, asks him
to send workmen and oxen to Brescia, to cut down and cart
to Rome some trees for beams in the church of SS. Peter
and Paul, promising him in return a <i>dono che non sarà
indegno di voi</i> (a gift not unworthy of you).<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 600, Cacanus, King of the Avari (Huns), sent to
Agilulf for marine architects and workmen to build the
boats with which Cacanus took a certain island in Thrace.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>As for the Comacine Masters at home, they had plenty
of church-building.</p>

<p>The seventh and eighth centuries were times of great
devotion to the Church, and consequently a great church-building
era. King Luitprand realized this so strongly
that he added to the laws of Rotharis, a clause permitting
his subjects to make legacies to the Church <i>pro remedio
animæ suæ</i>; a law, by the way, which was not always
healthy in its action; for it permitted the evil-disposed
to indulge in crimes during their lifetime, and then, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
defrauding their natural heirs of their inheritance, to
secure, as they believed, their souls against eternal punishment,
by leaving funds for building a church or a
monastery.</p>

</div>
<p>The will of Eriprand, Duke of Cremona, dated 685, is
still extant, with a legacy to the churches of S. Maria
Maggiore, and S. Michele in Borgo, of that city. Pope
Sergius I. restored the Basilica of Ostia, and founded S.
Maria in Via Lata, giving them rich gifts, and Pope John
II. repaired and endowed S. Maria in Trastevere.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Bertharis and Godebert, sons of Aribert, were in 661
dethroned by Grimoald, Duke of Beneventum; but
Bertharis being re-established in 671, recalled his wife
Rodelinda and son Cunibert from Beneventum, where they
had been taken as hostages, and in sign of gratitude for
their release, founded the church of S. Agatha al Monte at
Pavia,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> while his wife Rodelinda founded that of S. Maria
<i>fuori le mura</i> in the same city. Bertharis dedicated his
church to S. Agatha because on the eve of S. Agatha's day
he was miraculously saved from being assassinated by
Grimoald, his deposer. On the façade of the church is inscribed,
"Pertharitus Longobardorum Rex Templum hoc
S. Agathæ Virg. et Mart. dicavit anno Christi DCXXVII."</p>

<p>The church had the usual "three naves," and the façade
faced the west. It has since been turned round. As in
the Middle Ages it menaced ruin, the central nave had to be
supported by large external buttresses and internal arches,
one of which may be seen above the present doorway; it
once formed the entrance to the choir. When the nave was
restored some of the old Lombard capitals were discovered
under the brickwork. They show the same style as those
at S. Michele, and S. Pietro in Ciel d'oro at Pavia, and have
all the marks of Comacine work. One has two lions very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
well carved. They meet at the corner, where one head
serves for both. On another is a human figure, his hands
holding two dragons which he has conquered, but whose
tails still coil round him. A fine mediæval allegory of man's
struggle with sin.</p>

<p>Rodelinda's round church, S. Maria foris portam (now
no more), became better known as S. Maria <i>delle pertiche</i>
(of the poles), because a royal cemetery was there in
which many Lombard kings and nobles were buried, and
according to the usage of the nation the graves were
marked by wooden poles, on the top of each of which was
perched a wooden dove (emblem of the soul), looking
towards the place where the person had died or been
killed.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>We may account for its circular shape by the fact that it
was more a ceremonial church, than one for ordinary worship.
In it Hildebrand was crowned, or rather received the regal
wand of office. It had an interior ambulatory, an arched
colonnade all round it under the roof in true Lombard style.
This colonnade was much used in circular churches to
assist the want of space on great occasions.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Some of the
columns were fluted, and appear to have been adapted from
an earlier Roman edifice. Two of them, shortened and with
the fluting planed down, now adorn the gate of Pavia
towards Milan. The foundation of this church has been
attributed by Cattaneo to Ratchis. This cannot be, for in
736, ten years before Ratchis was king, Luitprand became
very ill, and the Longobards met in the church of S. Maria
delle pertiche, and proclaimed Hildebrand as his successor.</p>

<p>To Aribert II. (701-712) is attributed the foundation of
the church of S. Salvatore, outside Porta Marengo at Pavia,
where, says Malaspina, may be noted a great improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
in style in the acute arches, and more regular and elegant
proportions.</p>

<p>The Basilica of S. Pietro de Dom in Brescia dated
from about this time, though it was built independently of
Longobardic royal patronage, being a thank-offering by
Bishop Anastasius for the triumph of the Church over
Arianism. This was destroyed when the new Duomo was
built in the seventeenth century, but ancient writers tell us
it had all the true Lombard symbolism of form. The choir
was on the west, facing east; it had the triple nave and
triple apse, and the usual inequality of the columns, some of
which are large, others small; some long, others short,
these last being lengthened, some by white marble, others
by dark. I do not understand the significance of this
diversity of column which may be seen in all the Comacine
churches of this era.</p>

<p>If we cannot see S. Pietro de Dom, we may see in
Brescia a church equally old, the Rotonda of Santa Maria
Maggiore, which the chroniclers say was begun by the
Brescian Duke Marqward, and finished by his son Frodward,
with the assistance of King Grimoald, about 665. The
plan of the church is very interesting; there are two concentric
circles, the inner one formed by eight pilasters,
whose arches sustain the dome, and form the front of the
usual ambulatory above. This is all that can be judged as
belonging to the seventh-century church. The tribune
and the upper parts are later, and the crypt is earlier,
being, it is believed, the remains of an early Christian
church of S. Filastrio, though some claim it as Roman.</p>

<p>Cunibert is next on the list of Longobardic church-builders.
He built a church to St. George as a votive
offering after his escape from the attempt which was made
to dethrone him in 691 by Alachi, Duke of Brescia, and
two citizens named Aldone and Gransone. To the church
of St. George was attached a cloister for monks, the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Longobardic monastery founded in the diocese of Milan.
Documents and diplomas, dated 784 and 901, prove the
existence of both buildings till the latter date, but a deed
of sale in 998 only speaks of the church, which still existed
in 1792.</p>

<p>On the king's triumphal return to Pavia, he erected at
the door of S. Giovanni, a grand tomb to the priest Zeno,
who had lost his life for him, by dressing in the royal
armour and rushing from the king's tent into the battle.</p>

<p>In <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 700 Cunibert descended to Lucca, which had
then become a Longobardic town, and interested himself
in the building of a church to the three saints, Stephen,
Laurence, and Vincent; it afterwards became S. Fredianus.
The actual patron may not have been Cunibert himself,
but his majordomo Faulus, who probably was his vice-gerent
there. Two ancient deeds in the adjoining monastery
of St. Vincent and S. Fredianus, dated respectively 685 and
686, prove that Faulus restored and richly endowed the
monastery, and that Bishop Felix afterwards conceded to
the Abbot Babbinus and his monks, a diploma confirming
the munificence of Faulus. The monastery was, so say
the chroniclers, originally built by S. Frediano, Bishop of
Lucca, in the sixth century, and that, when the first unconverted
Longobards came down and drove him out and
destroyed his cathedral, he fled for some years, but on his
return he built another church outside the town with a
monastery attached. In this he availed himself of the
sculptured stones and columns of the ancient Roman
amphitheatre, erected in Lucca by Vibius in the time of
Trajan. This was the monastery which was restored by
Faulus. When the bones of S. Fredianus were removed
to it, in the time of the Bishop Giovanni II., the church
became known as S. Fredianus. The church built in
Cunibert's time was not by any means the fine building
we see now, though, as in Monza, the form of the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
building may be perceived. The ancient apse which has
been traced in the course of some excavations, is a fifth
smaller than the present one, and it is conjectured that the
old church, if turned the same way, would have ended
near where the present pulpit stands; and there was a
portico in front of it which is mentioned in some
ancient MSS.</p>

<p>The church was certainly differently orientalized, following
the symbolic formula that the choir should face the
east; for the excavations disclosed part of the columns of
the nave, buried under the present presbytery at the back.
The circular walls of the choir were retraced in front of
the present altar, and it was proved that the wall was not
continued where the semi-circle of the apse opens; whereas
if the church had been in the same direction it now takes,
the walls would have been continued to the length of the
nave.</p>

<p>Cav. Cordero di S. Quintino, in his <i>Disamine su di alcuni
monumenti Lucchesi</i>, 1815, was the first to draw attention
to the reversed plan of the old church, which the recent
excavations have proved. He states that it was in the
form of a Latin cross, had a nave, and four aisles and
transepts; that its choir was at the west end, facing
east, its façade on the east. It is a misfortune that its
origin cannot be precisely proved, as the archives of S.
Fredianus must have been burned in 1596, when the convent,
with other houses, was set on fire, even if they had
survived the former sacking and burning of the Ghibellines,
under Uguccione della Faggiola in 1314.</p>

<p>Next comes <i>Hic gloriosissimus Rex</i>, Luitprand, who,
we are told, built many Basilicæ in honour of Christ, in
the places where he had his residences. He was to
Lombard art what Lorenzo de' Medici was to that of the
Renaissance. Luitprand was a great employer of our
Comacine Masters, and very probably found them expensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
luxuries, for, as we shall see in the next chapter, he was
obliged to legislate to fix their prices. He even gave the
length of his royal foot, as a guide to measurement.</p>

<p>Luitprand's foot was said to have been an extra long
one, and yet, after great discussions among writers, it has
at length been agreed that Luitprand's foot, and the Roman
one used before it, were of the same length!</p>

<p>Very little, which is at all authentic, remains to us of
Luitprand's churches. S. Pietro<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> in Ciel d'oro (of the
golden roof), at Pavia, which was consecrated by Pope
Zacharias in 743, is now a mere modern church, containing
nothing but the round form of its apse to speak of its
antiquity. This golden roof must refer to some mosaics
originally in the tribune, and is, I believe, the first instance
of mosaics being used in a Lombard church. It was built
by the Christian king, "for the better reverence of the
sacred remains of that great light of the church, St. Augustine,
which were placed here by him." The corpse of
the saint was redeemed from the Saracens in Sardinia in
743, and the relics remained in S. Pietro for ten centuries.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Luitprand's church, we are told, was symmetrical and
graceful (<i>grazioso</i>). The façade was of the usual Lombard
form, with a rather flat gable, and galleries beneath the
eaves; it had narrow, round-arched windows, and a cross
over the central one, cut deep in the stone, as we see in
S. Michele in Pavia.</p>

</div>

<p>The finest existing church of the Longobardic times is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the Basilica of S. Michele at Pavia, which is still intact,
and may be taken as the culminating point of the first
Lombard style. It has all the distinctive marks of Comacine
work at the period. There is the Roman form of the
Latin cross with nave and two aisles divided by clustered
columns supporting round arches. The walls above the
central nave terminate in a sculptured string course, and
over that a clerestory, the double Lombard arches of
which are divided by marble colonnettes with sculptured
capitals. The central nave terminates in a semi-circular
apse, surrounded with pilasters and arches; beneath it is
a crypt supported on two rows of columns whose capitals
are covered with bizarre sculptures. The crypt is now
entered by steps beneath the ones leading to the tribune,
but originally it had two entrances at the sides of the
tribune as in the crypt at Torcello, and that of San Zeno
at Verona, which are also of the seventh century. Another
particularity is in the inequality of the aisles, the left wall
tending to the right, the right transept being longer and
larger than the left. This is not, we are told, an accident,
but one of the many symbolical forms used by the Comacines.
Cordero and Vitet both refer to it. The latter
says&mdash;"Souvent le plan de l'église penché de gauche à
droite. Cette inclination est attribuée, comme on sait, au
pieux désirs d'imiter la position du Sauveur expirant sur la
croix."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> As a whole the interior is grand and imposing,
and as it stands now, retains the general plan of the
original church. Some parts have been restored in the
fifteenth century, especially the four principal piers which
sustain the central arch, but by the difference in the work
and in the sculptures we may easily distinguish the added
parts. A Latin inscription in the apse, without date, proves
that the great central arch of the roof and that of the
choir were renewed by Bartolommeo Negri. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
a Bartolommeo Negri who was canon in 1496, but the
antique style of the epitaph would point to an earlier
restorer of the same name (we all know how families keep
the same set of Christian names for centuries in Italy),
especially as the painting in the apse is attributed to
Andrino d'Edesia, who lived about 1330. Some interesting
relics in the church are the circular slabs of black and
green marble, now in the floor of the nave. Tradition,
confirmed by Padre Romualdo, says that these were the
stones on which the daïs was placed for the coronation of
the Lombard kings.</p>

<p>Just as the interior of S. Michele at Pavia is the most
perfect existing example of the classical form reduced by
the Comacines to Christian use and symbolism, so is the
façade as perfect a specimen of their mediæval-oriental
decoration at this time as can be found. We give an
illustration of it.</p>

<p>The Comacines at this era were perfectly sincere and
their façade was always a true face to the church. The
eaves with the airy gallery of colonnettes beneath them
followed the exact line of the low-pitched roof. It was
only when they became eclectic, and their style got mixed
and over-florid, that the false fronts such as we see at
Lucca came in. The inward division of nave and aisle
is faithfully marked on the outside by piers or pilasters.
S. Michele has four pilasters dividing it into the three
portions, each one supplied with its round-arched door.
In the fifteenth century the central windows were altered
and a large ugly round orifice was placed above the three
Lombard ones. But in 1861 they had the good taste to
open the original windows, indications of whose masonry
were visible in the wall, and to add the cross, deep cut in
the stone, which was a distinctive feature in façades of
this era. Indeed the church may be taken as a type, in
all its aspects, of the Romano-Lombard building. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
most remarkable part is perhaps its ornamentation, which
is unique and fanciful to the highest degree. Besides the
carvings on door and window, the whole façade is striped
with lines of sculptured stones, a queer mixture of angels,
demons, saints, and monsters, that seems a nightmare
dream of mediæval superstitions, but are really a mystic
Bible in stone. I shall speak more fully of this in the
chapter on Lombard ornamentation.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_52">See page 52.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>We must now turn for a few moments to its history, on
which great uncertainty rests. Some authors say that
S. Michele at Pavia was built by Constantine the Great
as a thank-offering for the aid given him by that Saint
in his victory over the Franks in 325; but it is possible
they may have confused this church with the one which
Sozomenus asserts that Constantine erected to St. Michael
on the banks of the Hellespont. Other writers, of whom
Malaspina is one, claim it as an Ostrogoth foundation;
others again, finding a suspicion of Arianism in the
sculpture of the Annunciation on the south side of the
church, assign it to Agilulf before his conversion from
Arianism; while Gabriel Rosa, author of <i>Storia dei feudi
e dei comuni in Lombardia</i>, attributes it to King
Grimoald.</p>

<p>This last, however, is disproved by one of Paulus
Diaconus' curious stories. He says "that in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 661, King
Bertharis being in peril of his life by the usurper Grimoald,
was saved by his faithful servant Unulphus, who, throwing
over his royal master's shoulders a blanket and a bearskin,
drove him with ill words out of the palace, making believe
he was a drunken slave. Having thus eluded the guards,
who were in Grimoald's pay, and put the king in safety,
Unulphus fled for refuge to the Basilica of St. Michael,
till the new king pardoned him."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The church is again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
mentioned by Paulus Diaconus when he relates how in
737, when Luitprand judged Pemmonis, Duke of Friuli,
and other noble Longobards accused of sacrilege against
Callistus, Patriarch of Aquileja, one of them named
Ersemar fled for refuge to the Basilica of St. Michael.
Again in 774 a certain Trinidius, agent of King Desiderius,
left a house near the Pò at Gravenate, as a legacy to the
"Basilica beatissimi Archangeli Michaelis intra civitatem
Ticinensum pro anima sua." All these things go to prove
that the church existed before Luitprand's time, and that it
was especially venerated.</p>

<p>St. Michael, being a warlike saint, was the Longobards'
favourite object of reverence. When Alachi tried to depose
King Cunibert, he suddenly and mysteriously refused to
fight the king, because he saw a vision of St. Michael
standing beside him; then Alachi knew the battle would
go against himself if he hazarded it.</p>

<p>When the Longobards went forth to war, they carried
the effigy of St. Michael before them on their standard.
It was also impressed on their coins with the inscription
<i>S. C. S. Màhel</i>, or sometimes <i>Mihail</i>, spelling in those
days not being at all a fixed quantity.</p>

<p>But to return to our church-building king, Luitprand.</p>

<p>He erected the monastery of S. Abbondio at Bercela in
the mountains, and one dedicated to S. Anastasia, near
his suburban villa called <i>Cortelona</i> (Corte di Alona). In
this villa he had a private chapel, he being the first prince
who had daily mass said by priests in his own house.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
He had a favourite doctor named Gunduald, who, assisted
by Luitprand's royal munificence, founded the monasteries
of Palazzolo and Pitiliano near Lucca. At his intercession
Luitprand, by a diploma dated 742, gave Magister Piccone,
Gunduald's architect, lands in Sabine, which shows the value
Luitprand set on the arts, and this Magister especially.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>Astolfo, a later king, was an equally liberal patron of
the arts; he gave the revenues of the church of S. Pietro
at Pavia to Auripert, a painter whom he greatly esteemed.
Astolfo built the monastery of Nonantola, of which some
parts still remain, proving its fine architecture. He seems
to have been very unscrupulous in his avidity for relics;
an anonymous MS. at Salerno, speaking of his fierceness
and audacity, says that, "having taken many bodies of
saints from the neighbourhood of Rome, he had them
removed to Pavia."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The same old chronicler does him
the justice to say that "he built both churches and
monasteries which he very largely endowed."</p>

<p>Next followed Ratchis, who on his brother Astolfo's
death came out of the convent to which he had retired
on abdicating in 749. His reign was of the shortest;
he soon went back to his convent, for Pope Stephen III.
wrote commanding him not to oppose the election of
Desiderius, who had been Duke of Friuli and was high in
favour with the Pope.</p>

<p>Desiderius was a liberal patron to the Comacine Guild,
and built monasteries, churches, and palaces. Of the first
we may record the convent for nuns near Milan, known as
La Maggiore, or the Greater. Its foundation by Desiderius
is mentioned in a diploma dated <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1002 in favour of the
Abbot of S. Ambrogio, who was in that year appointed
spiritual guardian to the nuns. At Brescia, of which town
Desiderius was a native, he built the monastery near Leno,
known as the <i>Monasterio Leonense</i>, and the still more famous
one of Santa Giulia for nuns, which he founded in 766.
Desiderius and his wife Ansa endowed this convent with
landed property which spread over all the Lombard kingdom.
It was first called S. Salvatore, but when the remains
of Santa Giulia were brought from Corsica and placed here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
it was re-dedicated to her. Its first Abbess was Desiderius'
own daughter, Anselberga, who took the vows here. Says
the old chronicler&mdash;"its opulence and the number of holy
virgins who have lived within its walls render it one of the
most illustrious convents in Italy."</p>

<p>Signor Odorici has exemplified the church in its Lombard
form to have been quadrilateral, divided by two peristyles
of eight columns each, into a nave and two aisles (or three
naves, as Italian architects say). The arches are <i>a tutto
sesto</i> (semi-circular), and support walls bordered with a
simple string course. There was originally a semi-circular
apse or tribune, which was probably flanked by two smaller
ones. The white marble columns are, or were, of different
proportions, the capitals being sculptured, some in marble
and some in <i>arenaria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The mixture of Roman and Byzantine types in these is
taken by Ricci<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> to be a proof of its really dating from the
time of Desiderius, when the two styles got confused. Some
capitals are entirely of Byzantine design, others imitate the
Corinthian. On one is a mediæval sculpture of the martyrdom
of Santa Giulia, on another is the effigy of Queen
Ansa. These two are doubtless Comacine work of the
eighth century.</p>

<p>Up on the slope of Monte Civate near Lake Annone, an
hour's climb from the village of Civate, is an ancient
Lombard church dedicated to St. Peter, which is almost
intact. It is said to have been built as a thank-offering by
King Desiderius. His son Adelgiso was chasing a wild
boar on this mountain, and suddenly became blind. The
father vowed that if he recovered, a church to St. Peter
should be built on the spot. Adelgiso soon after recovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
his eyesight, and Desiderius was faithful to his oath. An
ancient MS. said to be contemporary,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> minutely describes
the ceremonies, when the king with all his royal pageantry
came up the mountain to lay the first stone. The plan is
similar to most other Lombard churches of its era. A great
flight of twenty-seven steps leads up to the portico, beneath
which is the principal door. This, however, does not lead
immediately to the church, but to a covered atrium, on the
lateral walls of which are sculptured in relief, hippogriffs
with triple tails, <i>i.e.</i> threefold mysteries. The entrance into
the nave has two spiral columns,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> an unusual form for the
Comacines of that era. There is a great peculiarity in the
position of the altar, which is a low table without a reredos,
standing on the tribune, to which five steps give access.
The <i>palio</i> faces the choir, so that the priest when celebrating
would confront the people, and face the east.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It
would be a question for archæologists whether, considering
the reverse orientalizing of Lombard churches, in
comparison to later ones, the front of the raised tribune
was not the usual position of their altars. This is the only
church which seems enough intact, to judge by. The altar
was placed beneath a canopy supported on four slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
columns, whose sculptured capitals show the symbolic
animals of the four Evangelists. The canopy has rude
bas-reliefs of the Saviour and apostles, the crucifixion
and resurrection. There are remains of similar altars
at Corneto Tarquinii in the south, and at S. Piero in
Grado near Pisa. The rest of the building is entirely
unadorned, excepting by some carved capitals of columns
in the crypt.</p>

<p>The church-building days of King Desiderius were now
drawing to a close. He thought he had strengthened
his seat on the throne by alliances with the all-powerful
Charlemagne of France, whose brother Carloman married
Desiderius' daughter Gilberga; and some historians assert
that his son Adelchi espoused Gisla, the sister of Charlemagne.
Here we have the link connecting the Comacine
Masters under the Lombard rule, with Charlemagne, through
whose patronage they spread northward, developing the
Gothic architecture. Politically the link was not a strong
one. In 770, Charlemagne having been menaced by Pope
Stephen III., the protector of Desiderius, revenged himself
by causing Carloman to repudiate Gilberga and send her
back to her father with her two sons. Carloman died in
771, and Pope Stephen III. did not live long after him, for
in 772 Charlemagne entered into a league with the new
Pope Adrian I. to dispossess Desiderius of his kingdom.
This unkind scheme was by Pope Adrian dignified by the
name of a "restitution to the Holy See."</p>

<p>The famous unequal fight at Pavia, between Desiderius
and the multitudinous hosts of France, is well known.
Desiderius was vanquished, and the Longobardic supremacy
of two centuries was over.</p>

<p>Charlemagne vaunted himself in having released Italy
from the Longobardic yoke, but whether his own yoke were
lighter is an open question. In any case there was no
"restitution to the Holy See." The Lombard cities were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
no more given to the Pope by Charlemagne, than they had
been by Desiderius. On the contrary, he crowned himself
<i>Rex Francorum et Longobardorum</i>, and his son Pepin
inherited the same title.</p>

<p>With him begins the next era in the development of
Comacine art.

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

CIVIL ARCHITECTURE UNDER THE LONGOBARDS</h3>

<p>Ecclesiastical as was the work of the guild, the
Comacine of Lombard times was nevertheless a fine civil
architect. He worked as willingly for the prince in palace-building
and for the country in fortification, as for the
Church in building monasteries and cathedrals. Indeed
war of all sorts bore such a large proportion in the life of
the Middle Ages that the fortress was of more importance
than the home.</p>

<p>In civil architecture the <i>Magistri Comacini</i> of the
seventh and eighth centuries followed much the same
style as in their ecclesiastical buildings, of course adapting
it to its different uses. In the Lombard palace we find
on the upper floor the usual double-light windows, with
the two round arches and dividing column enclosed in a
larger arch of masonry.</p>

<p>We also find the inevitable Lombard cornice beneath
the roof. In civil buildings, instead of a complete gallery
with colonnettes, this becomes a row of brackets with
carvings in the corbel heads. The windows of the lower
floor are square orifices barred with iron, for defence in
warlike times. The walls are either of the solid brickwork
<i>opus romanum</i>, or the great smoothly hewn stones of
the <i>opus gallicum</i>. In Lombardy there are more of the
former, as clay for bricks is easily attainable. In Tuscany
and southward the buildings are more frequently of stone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
The Florentine Bargello, though later, offers a very fine
specimen of this work, in the older portions of wall, where
the smooth-cut stones fit solidly together. If the building
required an inner courtyard it was of the same Lombard
style as their churches&mdash;showing the round arch, and the
convex capital, often sculptured.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_61"><i>See page 61.</i></a></p>
</div>
<p>The municipal palace only came in with the Communes
after 1100. In Longobardic times, the only buildings that
had any pretensions to architecture were the palaces of the
dukes or kings. Luitprand's palace in Milan, which fell
into disuse after the tenth century, is as graphically
described by old chroniclers and in legal documents in the
archives of St. Ambrose, as Theodolinda's at Monza had
been by Paulus Diaconus.</p>

<p>Before the days of the Communes, when the Brolio or
Broletta, and the Palazzo Pubblico were as yet unknown,
the palace of the ruling prince was the hall of justice, the
nearest Basilica being the public meeting-place. King
Luitprand's palace was styled in his time <i>Curtis ducati</i>.
In Charlemagne's reign it was <i>Curti domum Imperatoris</i>;
in other parchments <i>Curtis Mediolanensis</i>. Across the
front ran an open gallery, called <i>Laubia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> formed, as were
the galleries of the Comacine churches, of a row of arches
on colonnettes. Here the <i>placiti</i> were held, and sentences
pronounced, as in the regal and imperial public buildings,
the populace being assembled in the street below. The
<i>ringhiera</i> of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence served the
same purpose in Communal times.</p>

<p>The Loggia, which is such a feature in all old Italian
houses, is the natural descendant of the <i>Laubia</i>. In its
private aspect, as part of a citizen's house, the Loggia was
the place where the master of the house received his
friends.</p>

<p>An ancient MS. by Landolfo tells us that the space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
occupied by Luitprand's palace was not very wide. It
extended from the monastery of St. Ambrose to the church
of St. Protasius ad Monacos (now no more), and the road
leading to it was known as <i>Strada de Civite Duce</i>.</p>

<p>That King Desiderius also employed the Masonic guild
in civil as well as ecclesiastical architecture seems implied
by the tradition of his palace at S. Gemignano. Certain it
is that a solid mediæval building with decidedly Lombard
windows and Lombard arches under the machicolations,
exists at S. Gemignano, but whether it was really built by
and for Desiderius, I leave wiser antiquaries to judge.
The style is that of the times.</p>

<p>As a rule, Lombard houses had small rooms. This
seems to have applied even to royal and public buildings,
for, as mentioned above, all public meetings had to be held
in a church, or in its ante-portal. When Desiderius convoked
a Diet at Pavia, each prince or bishop was assigned
a house which had a church or oratory near, in which he
could meet his committee.</p>

<p>The different methods and processes of house-building
are very plainly enumerated in the laws of Luitprand, of
which we have given the headings on a previous page. It
would seem that since the reign of Agilulf, the Masters of
the Guild had become overbearing, and by Luitprand's
time required to have special legislation to limit their
prices. Luitprand's code of laws regulated the strength of
the external walls of a building, in regard to the different
height, construction, and material.</p>

<p>Art. 160 speaks of two different constructions, the
Roman mode, and the Gallic style. It begins&mdash;"Similiter
romanense si fecerit, sic repotet sicut gallica opera."
(Roman work shall be accounted of equal value to Gallic
work.) This distinction of terms has caused great
argumentation among commentators. Prof. Merzario<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
that "two national terms cannot apply to any small
distinction of masonry," and he takes them to mean the
Roman style with the round arch, in which most Lombard
churches are built, and the Gothic with the pointed arches.
As, however, Charlemagne's church, the father of the
Gothic, was not yet built in Luitprand's time, we should be
more inclined to take the opinion of Marchese Ricci and
Troya, who interpret the phrase <i>opus gallicum</i> to mean
the style which they say was introduced into Ravenna by
Theodoric and his Goths, and which they brought from Gaul.
It was the most solid style imaginable, seemingly a remnant
of Cyclopean building; if so it was not Gallic at all, but
came from the Pelasgi through the Etruscans, and so was
a natural sequence of Italian architecture; the Etruscans
having taught the Romans. It consisted of hewn stones
of large size and perfect fitness, still further strengthened
with cement. "Mirum opus manu gothica, et quadris
lapidibus," it was said of the builders of S. Oveno at
Rouen. If this definition be admitted, then the other
term <i>opus romanum</i> would mean building with flat bricks,
which was equally practised by the Comacines, especially
in Lombardy.</p>

<p>Luitprand's laws speak of the <i>asse</i>, <i>tavolati</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> <i>scindule</i>
(Longobardic term) by which the houses were internally
divided, and of a cheap species of house-building called by
the Gauls <i>pisè</i>, probably from the same root as <i>pigiato</i>
(pressed together). According to that method, the walls
were composed of masses of earth pressed, and then bound
together so as to form a solid mass. The same method is
still used in Africa and Spain, and in Italy by the peasants
in the subalpine regions near Alessandria (Piedmont).</p>

<p>In Clause II., <i>De Muro</i>, where they use the term
<i>si arcum volserit</i>, it cannot refer to vaulted roofs, which
were then unknown, but to the slight arch of the window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
or door in the thickness of the wall, often only a sloping off
of stones. The roofs were supported on wooden beams,
and the laws determine the size and value of these, according
to whether they are <i>scapitozzati</i> or <i>capitozzati</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> hewn or carved. They also decide the quality of the
wood for beams or planking, and the cost of roofing in
regard to the number of wooden slabs or tiles required in
a raised roof.</p>

<p>Thus any Longobard who wished to build himself a
house, might consult the laws of Luitprand, and count the
cost beforehand.</p>

<p>These laws also decide the strength of the defensive
walls of a city. Law IV. gives the trade price of this sort
of work; for those built <i>in massa</i>, or <i>per maxa</i>, the
builder shall for every sixty feet be paid in <i>solidum
unum</i> (one soldo, a gold coin). Ricci adds&mdash;"This <i>per
maxa</i> is the same construction which the Greeks and
Romans styled <i>implectans</i>, <i>i.e.</i> conglomerate."</p>

<p>They had several kinds of walls, some of brick, others
with a base of stone (<i>nella base a sassi</i>), like the walls of
Milan, which have lasted till now.</p>

<p>Luitprand assigns different money for different kinds of
work. Thus at times the <i>Magistri Comacini</i> were paid
<i>solidum unum</i> for every foot of wall, sometimes <i>solidum
vestitum</i>, a distinction of soldi which has puzzled commentators
very much; some opining that <i>vestitum</i> refers to
a coin on which the emperor is represented as regally clad,
and others that it means a copper coin plated (<i>vestito</i>) with
gold.</p>

<p>We find also that terra-cotta vases were much used as
ornamentation in building. This style was, as we have said,
called "a cacabus." Broken vases were adopted in the
foundation of large buildings and houses; others, which
probably were not perfect enough for household use, were
built into the walls and put as ornaments between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
arches. The tower of S. Giovanni e Paolo at Rome and
the church of S. Eustorgio at Milan are good instances of
this style.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_099" id="i_099"></a>
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="336" height="422" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tower of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, Rome, 12th century.</span><br />
(<i>From a photograph by Alinari.</i>)</p>
<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_65">See page 65.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Here we have another link with ancient Rome. Promis
instances an amphora found in the walls of an imperial
edifice in Aosta. At the fountain of Egeria, near the Porta
Tiburtina in Rome, the walls are full of amphoræ and
oil-jars.</p>

<p>On the whole these Masonic laws show that the
principal scope of the Longobardic architecture was to
make strong and lasting buildings.</p>

<p>The building of convents were frequent commissions of
the Comacines, and in these, as in their churches, they had
a set form. A solid framework of walls either of hewn
stone, in the Gallic manner, or of brick in the Roman style,
and a few beams and planks, were the simple elements of
which a convent was composed.</p>

<p>But of course a Comacine could not make any building
without his slight columns and arches, and here he disposed
of them in his cloister. This, too, was a heritage from
classic Rome, recalling the atrium. A Lombard or
Romanesque cloister is a delight. Here you have a square
court more or less spacious, containing a picturesque well in
the centre, surrounded by a colonnade of small columns
generally in couples, resting on a low wall and supporting a
roof on a row of arches. It was usually on the sunny cloister
that the Comacine poured out his imagination; here are
fancifully-sculptured capitals, pillars of every variety of form
and style, grotesque gargoyles between the arches, and
often delicate tracery above them. Hope<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> instances as the
more rude and early style of Lombard cloisters, those of San
Lorenzo at Rome and Santa Sabina and San Stefano at
Bologna, and as models of the more splendid style those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
S. John Lateran, which are resplendent with porphyry,
serpentine, and gold enamel, inlaid in the marble; and those
of S. Zeno of Verona of every tint of marble which the
Euganean hills can afford. For the interior arrangements
of a Longobardic monastery we will take Padre Ricci's
account of the first plan of Monte Cassino which Petronax
the Brescian engaged the Comacines to build. "It had on
the ground floor a <i>Sala</i> anciently called <i>caminata</i>, because
the fire-place was there. The upper floor was divided by
wooden partitions into cells and other rooms requisite in a
cenobitic life. Although at that time houses only had
one floor, monasteries generally had two. Monte Cassino
boasted of three storeys, the upper one being only used for
keeping fodder and stores. As the chief aim was solidity
of building, great attention was paid to the proportionate
thickness of the outer walls. The laws determined the
adequate value of these, which were generally of the thickness
of five feet. The inner walls were of planks or <i>assi</i>&mdash;'si
cum axe clauserit.'"</p>

<p>This mode of separation by wooden partitions is still
usual in convents, though it has gone out of use in houses.
The convents of S. Marco and S. Salvi at Florence both
show this style of division for the cells. The windows were
protected by <i>abietarii</i> or <i>cancelli</i> (gratings) made of wood.</p>

<p>A strong point in Lombard building was the fortress,
which the <i>Magistri</i> were past masters in erecting. Their
castles and forts and city walls stand to this day solid and
strong, with towers standing up commandingly in all directions&mdash;all
the mediæval cities bristled with them; the tower
was, in fact, a weapon of war. On these, too, they set their
seal&mdash;the pillared Lombard window becoming larger and
more airy as the tower rises into the air, and the crowning
cornice of bracketed or pillared archlets.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>Their towers seem to have been of two forms, ecclesiastic
and civil. The ecclesiastical bell-tower, square with a
straight unbroken line, with neither buttress nor projection
till the summit, where the bracket-supported arches expand
like a flower. Sometimes each storey had a string course,
with smaller arches beneath it, as in the tower at Prato.
The windows, too, as we have said, had a fixed rule; they
are smaller below, and grow larger and more airy as they
ascend. You go up from a mere orifice on the first floor to
a one-arched window on the second, a two-arched on the
third, to a three or even four-arched one near the summit.</p>

<p>The characteristics of civil towers at this time were their
solidity as a means of defence, and their height as a means
of vigilance; they appear to be chiefly circular, offering no
corners, but a curved surface from which missiles could
easily glance off. The windows were narrow outside, expanding
wider within. If there were a double-light window, it
would be on the very high storeys, out of arrow aim. Nearly
all the ancient fortresses have round towers, but I know of
very few church towers that are so, except the one at Classe
near Ravenna.</p>

<p>Before the thirteenth century, neither brackets nor projecting
cornices were used, and the tower rose in a single
straight line from base to battlement, so that projectiles fell
straight down. It was later that architects discovered the
value of the projecting <i>baluardo</i>. As to battlements,
these too came from the antique; Babylon and Nineveh
show proofs of them, and Homer speaks of the battlemented
towers of Asia and Greece. Muratori<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> derives the Italian
term <i>merlo</i>, from <i>mirare</i> (to take aim), the battlements
being made for the shelter of the archers, and their convenience
in shooting. When fire-arms came in, the need of
battlemented towers ceased.</p>

<p>The principal Longobardic military towers remaining to
our day, are, the tower of the ruined fortress of Baradello,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
which dominates the road to Camerlata, and the towers, now
mutilated, in the wall of Como, one of which, erected on
arches, forms the gate of the city towards Camerlata.</p>

<p>The ninth-century sculptures on the altar at S. Ambrogio
prove that the Longobards had towers above their city
gates. The author of the <i>Ant. Longob. Milanesi</i> (Dissert.
iii. p. 193) says that the ancient gates of Milan, before the
enlargement of the walls, were of this construction with
towers over them. They were furnished with heavy wooden
doors covered with iron, which were suspended on chains,
and slid down in grooves in the wall, thus completely closing
the entrance&mdash;a portcullis, in fact. Livy, in his twenty-seventh
book, describes the gates of Rome as being of
the same construction; some existing examples at Rome,
Tivoli, and Pompeii prove the fact. A famous gate in the
time of the Longobards was the one chronicled by Paulus
Diaconus, which King Bertharis (671-686) caused the
<i>Magistri</i> to erect beside his palace in Pavia. It was
named the Porta Palatinense, and was, says Paulus
Diaconus, an admirable work (<i>opera mirifica</i>). Some
antique documents quoted by Passano,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> prove that this
gateway was furnished with bronze gates.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Some writers think that the battlemented fortress came
from the East, because ancient specimens of it are found
there. In reading an Italian translation of Procopius,
<i>Degli edifici di Giustiniano Imperatore</i>, I was struck
by the many slight expressions which seem to prove
that Justinian brought his fortress-builders into Byzantium
from Italy. Procopius says that Justinian made a new style
of fortress with towers all round the walls; with stairs in
the towers, and galleries (<i>baluards</i>) round them with holes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
in them to throw down stones, and that it was called
<i>Pirgo castello</i>, because in the Latin tongue, fortresses are
styled <i>castelli</i>. Now this description is precisely that of
an Italian fortress, such as the Comacines knew how to
build, and built for centuries all over Italy. If it came from
the East in ancient times, why was it specified by Procopius
as a new style there?&mdash;and if its origin were Eastern, why
had they no name for it, but had to take the Latin one?</p>

<p>The Bishop of Salisbury, in a letter in the <i>Salisbury
Diocesan Gazette</i> (May 1898), speaks of an inscription of the
twelfth century, preserved in the museum at Jaffa, which is
in memory of Magister Filipus, who came over with the
King of England (Richard), and who had built a portion
of the wall "from gate to gate": evidently Magister Filipus
from the English Masonic Lodge, fraternized and worked
with his brethren of the Roman and Eastern Lodges.</p>

<p>Again, on p. 21, Procopius speaks of a town or village
now known as Eufratisia, but which was once
called Comagene, because there were Romans as well as
Persians living there. Romans, of course, meant subjects
of the Italian Empire, but the name Comagene is certainly
suggestive of those Italians being the Comacine builders
who made the castles. Then Procopius's description of the
rebuilding of the church of Santa Sofia is, to say the least of
it, interesting to a student of Lombard architecture. The
passage translated runs thus&mdash;"The church then (Sta Sofia)
being thus burned, was, at that time, entirely ruined.
But Justinian, a long while after, rebuilt it in such a form
that if any one in older times could have foreseen it, he
would have prayed God that the old church might be completely
destroyed, so that it may be rebuilt as it now is.
Therefore the Emperor sent to call artificers <i>and masters</i>,
as many as there were in all the universal world. And
Anthemius Trallianus, the head architect, was a great
machinist, learned in all kinds of machinery, not only that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of his own time, but in all that the ancients knew, and he
had the power to regulate and organize perfectly the
working of all things necessary to building, and to the
ordering and executing of his own designs and inventions.
And Isidore, another Milesian, was also a master of
machinery. The church then, was so marvellously made
that it was a beautiful thing to see; it seems supernatural
to those who behold it with their own eyes, and incredible
to those who only hear of it, because it is so high that it
seems to touch the sky.... The face of the church looks
towards the rising sun, but where the secret offices to God
are performed, it is built in this manner. It is a half-round
edifice which those of this profession call <i>Hemiciclo</i>, which
is to say half a circle ... and in this there are columns
planted beneath its floor." Here we have a decided Basilica
with raised tribune and semi-circular apse; both the form
and nomenclature seem to have been imported as a new
thing from Italy. "The golden dome appears suspended
from heaven, so light are the columns supporting it that it
seems to be in the air.... One can never arrive at understanding
how it was built (<i>apprendere l' arteficio</i>), but one
goes away astonished at one's inability to enough admire
such a work."</p>

<p>Does not this seem an argument for the universality of
the Masonic Brotherhood, even in Byzantine days? Here
are certainly Italian artists, Italian basilican forms, and
Italian nomenclature, among the Greeks working at Sta
Sofia. And here too are Lombard galleries and windows
with an Eastern touch added. Which way did the influence
come? Was this the origin of that characteristic Eastern
mark of the Lombard style in Italy?&mdash;or was it an importation
from Italy to Byzantium, where Procopius at least
seems duly astonished by it? It is a question for experts
to solve. There is much for the archæologist to do yet in
finding the true pedigree of architecture.

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

COMACINE ORNAMENTATION IN THE LOMBARD ERA</h3>

<p>The Comacine Masters were distinctly sculptor-architects,
and their ornamentation was an essential part of their
buildings. Yet, to them, sculpture was by no means mere
ornament. It was not a mere breaking up of a plain
surface, as a beautifying effect; nor a setting of statues
and niches for symmetry. It was an eloquent part of a
primitive language of religion and art. The very smallest
tracery had a meaning; every leaf, every rudely carved
animal spoke in mystic language of some great truth in
religion. But it was a language as yet artistically unformed,
because the mediæval man had more articles of creed than
he could express in words, and his hand like his mind was
as yet unpractised.</p>

<p>Thus it came that, as we have said, the Comacine Masters
were much given to symbolism.</p>

<p>The old Italian writers class this symbolism under two
heads&mdash;the <i>ermetica</i> (hermeneutic?), which they define as
symbolism of form or number; and <i>orfica</i> (orphic), that of
figures or representations. Under the first head would fall
the symbolical plan of their churches to which we have
referred; the form of the windows, which were double-lighted,
and emblematized the two lights of the law and the
gospel; the rounded apse, emblem of the head of Christ;
the threefold nave shadowing forth the Trinity; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
octagonal form of the baptisteries, which St. Ambrose<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
says was emblematical of the mystic number 8, etc.</p>

<p>Under the head of <i>orphic</i> would come all those mystic
signs of circle and triangle; of sacred monograms, and the
mysterious Solomon's knot;&mdash;that intricate and endless
variety of the single unbroken line of unity,&mdash;emblem of
the manifold ways of the power of the one God who has
neither beginning nor end. It would also include all the
curious possible and impossible animals that abound in
the Comacine work of earlier Longobardic times; all the
emblematic figures of angels and saints; and the figurative
Bible stories of the later Masters.</p>

<p>It has been said by Ruskin that the queer monsters sculptured
on the early Longobard churches, such as Sant'
Agostino at Milan, San Fedele at Como, and San Michele
at Pavia, were the savage imaginings of the lately civilized
Longobards, as seen through the medium of the sculptors
employed by them. This is, however, proved not to be
the case; animal symbolism was in those days an outward
sign of Christianity, which, in a time when there was no
literature, was to the unlettered masses a mystical religion
represented to their minds in signs and parables. Christ
Himself used this parabolic style of teaching. And it was
even more than that,&mdash;it was a sign of an older Bible lore
among the Hebrews, and other ancient peoples. As in
many early Christian ceremonies in the West (<i>i.e.</i> in
Europe) we can trace the remains of the old Latin
paganism, so in the East we may trace signs of the older
Hebrew faith.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Longobardic mixtures of labyrinths,
chimeræ, dragons, lions, and a hundred other things, which
at first sight do not seem to be connected with Christianity,
Marchese Ricci asks&mdash;"If these queer mixtures were only
the effect of the architects' caprice, whence came the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
impulse to such caprice? Not from classic Rome certainly.
Not from the Goths and Longobards, because they being
barbarians had to employ Italian artists."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The theory
propounded by Pietro Selvatico, in an article in the <i>Rivista
Europea</i>, is suggestive of a reply to this question. He supposes
that the Byzantines originally took their symbolism
from the Hebrews, and from the traditions of Solomon's
Temple, which are also shared by the Ph&oelig;nicians;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and that
this animal symbolism changed its character in the East,
owing to the restrictions imposed by the Emperor Leo and
his successors, but that in freer Italy it still flourished. It
is difficult to say whether the Comacines took their ornamentation
direct from the Byzantines at Ravenna in the
early centuries after Christ, or whether they got it by
longer tradition, from that same Eastern source from which
the Byzantines took theirs. It is true that Como had more
than one bishop who was a Greek,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and that when it fell
under the government of the Patriarch of Aquileja, the
Comacines were employed by him in Venice, Grado, and
Torcello, etc., where they would have seen a good deal of
Byzantine work; but their earliest employment at Torcello
was in the seventh century, and we have seen them using
their chisels for Theodolinda long before that time.</p>

<p>The Byzantine ornamentation became conventional after
726 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, when the Emperor Leo III. (the Isaurian) promulgated
his iconoclastic edict in the Eastern Empire.
Some Greeks had begun to feel that, under the appearance
of Christianity, they were only keeping up the ancient
paganism. They were taunted by the Hebrews and
Mussulmen, who, inspired by the Koran, had a great hatred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
of images. This sect found a champion in Leo III., who
had lived much among the Arabs, and shared their prejudices
against idols. He convoked a council, prohibited
images, and proscribed all reverence and use of them either
public or private. A figure of the Christ over his own
palace fell the first victim to his iconoclastic destruction.
Several Greeks who would not bow to this decree fled to
Italy, and put themselves under the protection of Pope
Gregory II. From this time the eastern Byzantine architectural
ornamentation was entirely confined to linear and
geometric design, and vegetable forms. In pure Byzantine
work one sees no dragons or fighting monsters, only
conventional doves and scrolls. The sculptors took to
imitating woven stuffs, and Oriental patterns in marble, and
to twining their capitals with conventional leaves, but the
life had gone out of their work; it was all set and precise,
but dead.</p>

<p>The Italian architect, not being under the power of the
edict of Leo, continued to carve his mythic animals, his
symbolic birds and fishes, and even tried his hand at the first
rude revival of the human figure in sculpture. His figures
were disproportionate and mediæval in form,&mdash;what could
one expect from a man of the Middle Ages just reawakening
to the conception of art?&mdash;but they were full of fire and life.
Their mystic beasts were horrible as any nightmare could
conceive them; they were indeed conceived in the darkness
of that night of superstition, ignorance, and fierce
strife. Their angels were grotesque, not from want of
imagination, but from want of models of form and proportion;
their men are full of all kinds of expression, with
their heads too large and their limbs too short; but their
attitudes are lively, their faces grotesquely keen.</p>

<p>As a proof of this distinctive style, compare the Byzantine
altar of S. Ambrogio at Milan, here illustrated, with
the Comacine pulpit of the same church. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_74"><i>See page 74.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>So many students of architecture roughly class as
Byzantine every kind of intricate decorative work of the
centuries before the Renaissance; but I think that, excepting
in some instances in Venice and Ravenna (and not all
the work of the era there), most of the Italian ornamental
sculpture is Comacine, and not Byzantine. Certainly if
you see a sly-faced lamb, or a placid lion with rolling eyes,
peering out from beneath the abacus of a column, or a
perky bird lifting up its claw over a vase, with an extremely
lively expression of eagerness, that work is not Byzantine,
though it may be surrounded and mixed with the most
intricate possible weaving of lines or foliage. However, I
leave the question of derivation of style to wiser students
than myself, and return to the Comacine Masters and their
symbolism.</p>

<p>It seems impossible that the Comacine sculptures on
S. Michele could have come through the Byzantine. It is
true they show rude and unskilled technical execution, but
they have intense spirit, belief, life, and spontaneity. The
<i>Magistri</i> must have got their ornamentation as they did their
architecture from an older source,&mdash;and a traditional one.
It came down like their Freemasonry from ancient Eastern
builders through pagan Rome, and ages of mystic religions
such as Gnostic and other deistic forms, till it became
incorporated in Christianity. "We might," says Sacchi,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
"define Christian symbolism as the representation of
mysteries and religious truths by means of forms, cyphers,
and determinate images." (<i>La rappresentazione di dogmi,
misteri e verità religiose, per mezzo di forme, cifre ed
immagini determinate.</i>)</p>

<p>An older and more authoritative testimony is given
by Dionysius the Areopagite, the associate of St. Paul, by
whom he was consecrated. In his <i>De angelica seu celesti
Hierarchia, Epistola ad Timotheum Ephæsiæ civitatis
episcopum</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
he writes&mdash;"It is necessary to teach the mind as
to the spiritual hierarchies, by means of material figures
and formal compositions, so that by comparing the most
sacred forms in our minds, we may raise before us the
spiritual and unpictured beings and similitudes on high."
As he says elsewhere, "ascendere per formas veritatim."</p>

<p>Again he writes to Titus&mdash;"Only by means of occult
and difficult enigmas, is it given to the fathers of science
to show forth mystic and divine truths."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In the second
epistle to Timotheus, St. Dionysius writes&mdash;"We must
raise ourselves from ascetic facts by means of imaginative
forms, and we should not marvel as do the unknowing, if
for this end are chosen many-footed beings, or creatures
with many heads; if we figure bovine images, or lions, or
eagles with curved beaks; flying creatures with three-fold
wings, celestial irradiations, wheel-like forms, vario-tinted
horses, the armed Sagittarius, and every kind of sacred
and formal symbol which has come down to us by tradition."
St. Nilus, too, writes to Olimpiodorus&mdash;"You ask me if I
think it an honourable thing that you erect temples to the
memory of martyrs as well as to that of the Redeemer&mdash;those
martyrs who are certainly among the saints, and
whose pains and sufferings have borne witness to the
gospel. You also ask whether it would be wise to decorate
the walls on the right and left with animal figures, so that
we may see hares (conies) and goats, and every kind of
beast flying away, while men and dogs follow them up.
Whether it would be well to represent fish and fishermen
throwing the line or the net; whether on the calcareous
stone shall be well-carved effigies of all kinds of animals,
and ornamental friezes and representations of birds, beasts,
and serpents of divers generations?" St. Nilus says later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
that he quite agrees with all these things; so if the Fathers
of the Church respected them, we need not heed Mr. Ruskin's
diatribes.</p>

<p>St. Nilus lived in the time of John XVI., 985-996,
nearly 900 years after Dionysius, but this extract from his
letter shows that Christian symbolism had not altered in all
those centuries, and the church he describes is no more or
less than a Comacine church of that era. The chase is
figured forth on the façades of S. Michele and S. Stefano
at Pavia, and S. Zeno at Verona. The huntsman and his
dogs are generally used as emblems of the faithful Christian
driving out heresies.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The fisherman symbolizes the priesthood,
fishing for souls out of the ocean of sin. There is a
beautiful example of this myth in the fresco of the ship
(the ark of the Church) on the roof of the Spanish chapel
at Santa Maria Novella in Florence, where the fisherman
is casting his line from the bank.</p>

<p>Seen through the medium of these early lights, we no
longer look on the façade of S. Michele as Ruskin does, as
a sign of savage atrocity, but every line of the time-worn
sculptured friezes stands out as full of meaning as an
Egyptian hieroglyphic, to one who can interpret it. On
the angle to the left we have the army of the Church
militant, figured as armed soldiers, whose horses trample
some quadrupeds underfoot: symbol&mdash;the vanquishing of
sins. Above this a frieze of four animals&mdash;first, a lion;
second, too much broken to be decipherable, but from the
context it is probably a man-headed creature; third, a bull;
fourth, a winged creature. Here we have the four beasts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
of the Apocalypse,&mdash;emblems of the Evangelists. "And
the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a
calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth
beast was like a flying eagle" (Rev. iv. 7). The connection
between the two friezes is evident. First, the Church
militant clad in the whole armour of God, and the second
emblematizing the shield of the Gospel.</p>

<p>In the next compartment of the façade, that on the left
of the door, we have the chase of a deer and other animals
flying from fierce dogs, which we have explained above;
over this a frieze of vine-leaves. Here, again, the connection
of thought is apparent. The vine figures Christ, the
only true refuge from heresy.</p>

<p>High up on each side of this left door is a peacock with
an olive-leaf in its claw-symbol of the Church bringing
peace. In the centre between these is the bishop with his
robes and pastoral staff&mdash;the visible dispenser of peace in
the Church. On the fourth frieze, which is above the door,
we go into the mythic animals: here is a hippogriff with
the three-fold tail; a woman with six breasts, carrying two
pine-cones; she is in a long robe with large sleeves, and
veiled as an Egyptian; two sphinxes, on each of which a
man rides, and whispers in their ears; a dragon with wings
and bird's feet, on its neck a child; a priest with vase of
holy water and an asperge, who is blessing some people; a
man (Zohak) between two winged serpents which bite his
head; a sphinx to whom a man presents a little branch of a
tree; two hippogriffs, seated opposite each other with a man
in the centre who places their claws on his head. A marvellous
frieze indeed, and one which in spite of St. Dionysius
speaks as much of Eastern traditions long before Christ, as
of Christianity itself. The many-breasted woman with the
pine-cones is the ancient mother goddess, Isis, Cybele, or
Cupra, according to the age and clime; here I take it the
old image is turned to new uses, and she figures Eve, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
primitive mother. The two sphinxes are obscure, but
they would seem to emblematize man wresting the secrets
of knowledge of good and evil from the mystery of the
unknown, as when Adam and Eve ate the apple; the
dragon, always emblem of sin or the devil, ridden by a
child, is a fine symbol of the child Christ, the seed of Eve,
who should overcome sin. Then comes the purification
by benediction, as shadowing Abel's accepted sacrifice, and
the serpent-fanged remorse of Cain, as shown in Zohak.</p>

<p>Next the man giving the branch to the sphinx must
shadow the reconciliation of man with God, and the hippogriffs
the final redemption of man. The hippogriff is a
combination of horse and eagle. The horse, as St. Dionysius
says, was symbol of evangelical resignation and submission;
if white, it sheds divine light. The eagle, he tells
us, is a high and regal bird, potent, keen, sober and agile;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the winged horse consequently stands for man's upward
flight to heaven through submission to God. In the fifth
frieze, the Christian virtues of strength, fortitude, sobriety,
and obedience are symbolized by bulls and horses.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Footnote_63">See Page 77, note</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Around the door are sculptures of the same kind of
emblems with vines entwining&mdash;which teach that all manly
strength must be used for Christ.</p>

<p>In the central portion are more friezes, all symbolizing
the struggle between good and evil; the war between
angels and demons; between man's earthly nature and his
heavenly soul.</p>

<p>Here are men fighting dragons, and struggling with
serpents; winged angels riding on heavenly horses; and
over the door the grand central idea, St. Michael triumphant
over the dragon-serpent, the favourite hero and great
example of those days.</p>

<p>On the other side of the church we seem to get the
symbolism of the New Testament. Here, mixed still
with the dragons and hippogriffs of the time, we can see
the Virgin with the Divine Child at her breast.</p>

<p>On the capitals of the north door, round the corner,
are the entirely Christian emblems of the man, the lamb,
a winged eagle, and two doves pecking at a vase, in which
are heavenly flowers. In the lunette, Christ is giving to
St. Paul on one side a roll of parchment, and on the other
hand entrusting the keys to St. Peter; under it are the
words: <i>Ordino Rex istos super omnia Regna Magistros</i>.</p>

<p>The capitals in the church are carved with similar subjects;
one has the emblems of the evangelists; another Adam
and Eve with the tree of knowledge on one side, and a
figure offering a lamb on the other. On one are griffins
at the corners, and Longobards with long vests, beard, and
long hair, crouching between them; on another, a virgin
martyr bearing the palm. The fourth column on the left
has a curious scene of a man dying, and an angel and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
demon fighting for his soul, which has come out of him
in the form of a nude child. Two pilasters show the
sacrifice of Isaac, and Daniel in the lions' den.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_80"><i>See page 80.</i></a></p>
</div>
<p>So we see, that mediæval as he was at that time, the
Comacine Master of the seventh and eighth centuries, even
though his execution were low, had a high meaning in his
work. As to the rudeness of the handling, there is this
to be said. We see the work after more than a thousand
years' exposure to the atmosphere, and the sculptures are
not in durable marble, but in sandstone, which has a habit
of getting its edges decayed, so we may fairly suppose the
cutting looked clearer when the ornamentations were fresh.
The form of both animals and men is, however, and
naturally always was, entirely mediæval, which seems
synonymous with clumsy.</p>

<p>The use of marble ceased for some centuries with the
fall of the Roman Empire. Theodosius had made a law,
forbidding any one below the rank of a senator to erect a
building of marble, or valuable <i>macigna</i>; thus the Christian
buildings after the fifth century were generally of humble
sandstone; and this continued till the time of St. Nilus,
who tells his friend that "in <i>arenaria</i> he may effigy every
kind of animal, which will be a delightful spectacle" (<i>dilettoso
spettacolo di veduta</i>). It was a stone peculiarly adapted to
building, as it was easily cut, and yielded to all the imaginations
of the sculptor with very little labour. I have
given an especially lengthy description of the façade of
S. Michele, because it embodies all the special marks of
the ornamentation of the Comacine under the Longobardic
era. The church of S. Fedele at Como is another instance;
here, too, the capitals of the columns, and the holy
water vase, which is held up by a dragon, are full of orphic
symbolism. The left door has an architrave with obtuse
angles bearing a chimerical figure, half human, half serpent&mdash;the
gnostic symbol of Wisdom. Serpents and dragons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
entwine on the lintels, and emblematize the Church's power
to overcome.</p>

<p>In studying the scrolls and geometrical decoration of the
Comacines, one immediately perceives that the <i>intreccio</i>,
or interlaced work, is one of their special marks. I think
it would be difficult to find any church or sacred edifice,
or even altar of the Comacine work under the Longobards,
which is not signed, as it were, by some curious interlaced
knot or meander, formed of a single tortuous line.</p>

<p>As far as I can find from my own observations, there
is this difference between the Byzantine and Comacine
mazes; the Byzantine worked for effect, to get a surface
well covered. His knots and scrolls are beautifully
finished and clearly cut with geometrical precision, but the
line is not continuous; it is a pretty pattern repeated over
and over, but has no suggestion of meaning.</p>

<p>The Comacine, on the contrary, believed in his mystic
knot; to him it was, as I have said, a sign of the inscrutable
and infinite ways of God, whose nature is unity. The
traditional name of these interlacings among Italians is
"Solomon's knot."</p>

<p>I have seen a tiny ancient Lombard church, in the
mountains of the Apuan Alps, built before the tenth
century, of large blocks of stone, fitted and dovetailed into
each other with a precision almost Etruscan. High up in
the northern wall is a single carved stone some three feet
long, representing a rude interlaced knot.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> We asked a
peasant what it was.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's an ancient <i>girigogolo</i>," said he, by which I
presume he meant hieroglyphic.</p>

<p>On going to a higher fount and asking the priest, we
got the information that it was a "Solomon's knot," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
that such <i>intrecci</i> were found on nearly all the very
ancient churches. He supposed it had some meaning&mdash;and
thought it expressed eternity, as the knots had no end and
no beginning. The Italian philologist, Sebastian Ciampi,
gives these interlacings a very ancient origin. "We may
observe," he writes, "in the sculpture of the so-called barbarous
ages on capitals, or carved stones, that they used
to engrave serpents interlaced with curious convolutions.
On the wall too they sculptured that labyrinth of line which
is believed to be the Gordian knot, and other similar ornaments
to which Italians give the generic name of <i>meandri</i>.
I do not think that all these representations were merely
adapted for ornament, but that they had some mystic
meaning. I am not prepared to say whether our forefathers
received such emblems from the Northern people
who so frequently peregrinated in Italy, or from the Asiatic
countries. This is certain, the use of such ornamentation
is extremely antique, and we find it adopted by the Persians,
and see it in Turkish money, and carpets, and other works
of Oriental art."<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Ciampi goes on to find the root of these
emblems, both the Runic knot and the Comacine <i>intreccio</i>,
in the Cabirus of the ancient Orientals. It is possible that
the ancient serpent worship of the Druids and other
Northern nations, was in some way descended from the
same root. In any case they were transmitted to the
Longobardic Comacines through the early Christian <i>Collegia</i>
of Rome, as we see by the <i>plutei</i> in San Clemente, S.
Agnese, etc., and by the beautiful single-cord interweavings
on the door of a chapel in S. Prassede.</p>

<p>There is a marvellous knot sculptured on a marble
panel of the ninth century from S. Ambrogio Milan, which
Cattaneo has illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The whole square is filled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
complicated interweavings of a single strand, forming intricate
loops and circles, the spaces between which are filled
with the Christian emblems, the rose, the lily, and the
heart. Another <i>pluteus</i>, originally from San Marco dei
Precipazi at Venice, but now over the altar at S. Giacomo,
is dated 829 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and is covered with what seems at first
sight a geometric pattern of circles and diamonds, but if
analyzed will be found a single strand interwoven in the
most mysterious and beautiful manner. It seems that the
parapet of the tribune in all these early Basilicas was the
place chosen especially by the Roman architect of the third
and fourth centuries, and the Comacine of the eighth
and ninth, to set their secret and mysterious signs upon,
and to mark their belief in God as showing infinity in
unity.</p>

<p>It is very curious to notice in the churches which the
guild restored in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
when their tenets had altered, and their sign changed,
how they themselves removed these old stones, but yet
being careful not to destroy them, they turned them and
sculptured them again on the other side. In the excavations
or restorations in Rome many of the <i>intrecci</i> have
come to light at the back of panels of Comatesque pulpits,
recarved into altar frontals, or used as paving-stones before
the altar.</p>

<p>Some of the earlier and less intricate forms of knots
may be seen in the church of S. Abbondio at Como, which
was built in the fifth century and again rebuilt in the ninth.
Some excavations in the last century revealed the foundations
of the fifth-century church, and also brought to light a
number of sculptured stones which had been turned face
downwards to form the pavement. We give illustrations
from two of these which have the Comacine signs plainly
written on them, and show even in this early and simple
form the reverence for the line of unity. Cattaneo thinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
they may have formed the front of the gallery above the
nave in the eighth-century building.</p>

<p>In the museum of Verona is a precious fragment of
Comacine work dating from Luitprand's time. It was a
<i>ciborium</i> which Magister Ursus was commissioned to
make for the church of S. Giorgio di Valpolicella. It is
especially valuable as the first dated piece of sculpture of
the Longobardic era, and the first signed specimen of
Comacine interlaced work. The columns which remain
support a round arch, covered with sculptured <i>intrecci</i>.
As it stands now the two halves of the arch do not match,
so it must be conjectured that the <i>ciborium</i> had four
columns, and that the halves of the arch were originally on
different sides of the erection. The <i>intrecci</i> are beautiful
and varied, displaying the unbroken continuity of the
curved line which marks the Comacine work of the
eighth to the twelfth centuries. The capitals are curious
in form and not at all classical. Beneath the capitals
of the two columns are the following inscriptions in
rough letters and dog Latin. One runs&mdash;"<span class="s08">IN NOMINE DNI.
IESU XRISTI DE DONIS SANCTI IUHANNES BAPTISTE. EDIFICATUS
EST HANC CIVORIUM SUB TEMPORE DOMNO NOSTRO LIOPRANDO

<p>The date of Bishop Dominic's death coincides with
Luitprand's accession to the throne, so we may safely say
Magister Ursus worked in 712. <i>Ursus Magister fecit</i> is
also engraved in the same style on an ancient altar recently
discovered in the abbey church of Ferentillo near Spoleto.
It is known that Luitprand went to Spoleto in 739, and
installed Hilderic in the Dukedom. In any case this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
inscription is of priceless value to our argument that the
Comacine Guild which worked for the Lombard kings was
really the same guild that built the latter Romanesque and
Gothic cathedrals and palaces. Here we get the exact
organization which becomes so familiar to us in the later
lodges whose archives are kept, Ursus or Orso proves his
right to the title of Magister by having disciples under him.
The work is done in the time of "Our Lord Luitprand and
our Father the Bishop," who are the presidents of the
lodge, just as in later lodges the more influential citizen
or body of citizens are presidents of the <i>Opera</i>. Then
there is Refol, the <i>Gastaldo</i> (Grand Master). The very
same term is kept up in the Lombard lodges till the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when the head of the
Venetian <i>laborerium</i> is styled the <i>Gastaldo</i> instead of <i>capo
maestro</i> as in Tuscany; there is even the notary to the
guild, the unworthy scribe Gondelmus.</p>

<p>The work is so far inferior to the <i>ciborium</i> at Valpolicella,
that it would seem to be, as Cattaneo remarks, by an
earlier hand. The ornamentation is not a finished sculpture,
but only rudely cut into the surface of the stone, like
a first sketch. Possibly the remuneration offered by the
employer was not liberal enough to encourage Orso to put
any elaborate work into the altar, or he might have blocked
out the work, and left it unfinished either by reason of
death, or absence.</p>

<p>Another famous work of that time was one which
Luitprand himself caused to be sculptured by Magister
Giovanni, of the Comacine Guild. It was the covering for
the tomb of S. Cumianus in the monastery of Bobbio. It
will be remembered that Agilulf and Theodolinda gave
shelter to the Irish Saint Columbanus, and assisted him to
found the convent of Bobbio. One of the monks there,
another Irishman, named Cumianus, was afterwards canonized,
and Luitprand built his tomb. We are told it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
covered with precious marbles, which would seem to
indicate something in the style which the Cosmati afterwards
made so famous.</p>

<p>The tomb of Theodata at Pavia is a fine specimen of
Comacine-Longobardic sculpture. It is now to be seen in
the cortile of the Palazzo Malaspina with some other old
sarcophagi. This has been called a Byzantine work, but
the extreme vitality and expression in the hippogriffs and
the Solomon's knots which sign it, mark the work as
Comacine; besides, we are told by the most early authors
that the Longobards never employed Greek artists. There
is the usual mixture of Christianity and Mediævalism in the
sculptures on the top of the tomb. Winged griffins with
serpent tails prance on each side of a vine, from which
serpents' heads look out. Fishes are in the corner, and an
interlaced border, whose spaces are filled with grapes and
mystic circles, frames, as it were, the design. The side is
entirely Christian; and if the peacocks which drink out of
a vase with a cross in it, were less lively, it might almost pass
for a Byzantine design; but the Comacine Magister has set
his mark even here, in his knots with neither end nor
beginning, his concentric circles, and roses of Sharon; and
has told us in his mystic language that Theodata was a
Christian, and though tempted, clung to the cross. Theodata,
a noble Roman dame, was one of the ladies
of honour to Ermelind, King Cunibert's Anglo-Saxon
wife.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>One day Ermelind incautiously described the exquisite
beauty of this lady, whom she had seen in the bath, and
greatly inflamed his imagination. He brutally ruined the
lovely Theodata, and afterwards shut her up in a
monastery, probably that of St. Agatha, which his father
had built. This took place in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 720. The beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
tomb was but a poor atonement for the coarse cruelty
which had spoiled her life.</p>

<p>The pulpit in S. Ambrogio at Milan is a really fine
specimen of sixth-century work. It is supported on ten
columns. Here is the true Comacine variety of columns:
they are all sizes and all shapes; some round, some
hexagonal; some longer, some shorter; the difference in
height being made up by the capitals and pedestals being
more or less high. One, which is peculiarly short, and
whose capital is carved in complicated Solomon's knots, has
a lion placed as abacus. This is the earliest instance I
know of, of the use of the lion of Judah, in connection with
the pillar (Christ). Here the lion rests on the column and
supports the arches, instead of being the root of the pillar
as it became in the later Romanesque style. The arches
are surrounded with intricate scrolls and interlaced work;
some of them clearly copied from Byzantine designs. The
spaces between the arches are enriched with allegorical
subjects. In one, the emblems of the apostles; in another,
a choir of angels, very mediæval and heavy-headed; in
another, a winged archangel. At the corner is a man
in Lombard dress, holding two animals, one in each hand.
It is peculiarly suggestive of the Etruscan deity with the
two leopards, which is so frequently seen on the black
Chiusi vases, and confirms more than ever, the tendency in
mediæval Christians to cling to ancient pagan forms, giving
them a new Christian significance. The frieze above the
arches which forms the base of the marble panels of the
Ambone, is peculiarly Comacine. Here are all the mystic
animals, representing the powers of evil;&mdash;dragons, wolves,
etc., bound together in a knotted scroll of one continuous
vine-branch, here and there training into foliage. Reading
the ornamentation by the light of mediæval symbolism, the
whole thing gives us lessons appropriate to a pulpit. It
tells us that Christ the pillar of the Church, descended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
from David the lion of Judah, is the foundation of all
Gospel; that angels and saints sing the glory of God; and
that Christ the vine can bind and subdue the powers of evil.
The fine early Christian tomb beneath the pulpit is not
necessarily connected with it. It has been called the tomb
of Stilicho, with how much reason I am not prepared to
say. If so it must date from the early part of the fifth
century, as it was on October 8, 405, that Stilicho marched
up to Fiesole from Florence to his victory over Radagaisus
the Goth. The Florentines had but just been converted
to Christianity at that time. The sculpture, though
Christian in subject, has many signs of debased Roman style
mingled with much of the mediæval.</p>

<p>There is a similar pulpit at Toscanella, in the church of

the choir facing east. The pulpit, which is of the square
form used before <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000, is supported on four columns,
and has sculptured parapets and arches, on which are
various interlaced designs of marvellous intricacy.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>We may safely say that Charlemagne, who was more a
warrior than a man of æsthetic tastes, had no influence
whatever on Italian architecture; neither the form nor the
symbolism was changed by him. The Italians were always
conservative, and clung to old traditions. The Roman
basilica, and not the Eastern mosque, still continued to be
the plan of the Italian church. Ricci asserts that by the
end of the eighth century all imitation of Oriental architecture
had disappeared from Italian churches. It was not
the same, however, with the ornamentations, in which the
frozen Byzantine forms became vitalized under hands less
technically skilful, but more natural.</p>

</div>

<p>Charlemagne did not even alter the Longobardic laws,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and he certainly did not interfere with the freedom and
privileges of the Comacines or <i>Liberi Muratori</i>. In fact
he ratified the Lombard code (the laws of Rotharis and
Luitprand), only adding a few others which are known as
<i>Capitolari</i>.</p>

<p>They do not, however, refer specially to our <i>Magistri</i>,
but to jurisprudence in general. The older laws still held
good for the Comacines, and they went on building their
Basilican churches, which were at the same time classic in
form, solid in style, and fanciful in decoration&mdash;a curious
and characteristic mixture. But Charlemagne certainly
patronized the Comacines, and not only employed them
himself, but sent them to restore Roman churches for Pope
Adrian, and to fortify Florence.</p>

<p>The early Carlovingian churches in Italy have so much
analogy with the Longobardic ones, that it is very difficult
to distinguish precisely to which era certain churches
belong.</p>

<p>Rumhor instances the Florentine Basilica of S. Scheraggio,
which was much used as a meeting-place for civil
councils in the early days of the Republic. This is usually
said to have been a Carlovingian church; but either it was
pure Lombard, as the barbarous name <i>Scheraggio</i> implies,
or else Charlemagne employed the Lombard architects.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Padre Richa, who saw the ruins of it, gives a design of the
church, which was the usual Lombard form, three naves,
the central one wide, and an apse to each. The columns
and capitals were from some Roman building.</p>

<p>The architecture was entirely similar to that of S. Paolo
in ripa d'Arno, close to Pisa, which has also been styled
Carlovingian. The chronicle of the monk Marco, written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in 1287, preserved in the archives of Vallombrosa, shows
that although the guide-books date S. Scheraggio as twelfth-century
architecture because a papal bull of that time refers
to the name, it belonged to the Vallombrosian monks long
before, having been given to them by Countess Beatrice
in 1073,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and was probably founded in the ninth century.</p>

<p>We must not omit to mention the most interesting of
Comacine churches, that of San Donato in Polenta, where
Dante worshipped, and near which Paolo and Francesca
lived. It was built in the eighth century, and is mentioned
in a document of 976. It is of the usual triple-apsed form.
The columns have diverse capitals, some square, some
diminished, ornamented with foliage and interlaced work;
some have grotesque figures, and animals in low relief, with
a rude technique. Here are men like monkeys, hippogriffs,
sea monsters, etc. It has been graphically described
in Sapphic verse by Carducci, as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>This church, so full of poetic and historic interest, was
lately going to be destroyed, but the priest, Don Luigi
Zattini, appealed to the Inspector of Monuments for the
province of Forli, who had recourse to the <i>Deputazione
Storica Romagnola</i>. Efforts were made to save it, and
instead of being pulled down, it is now only to be restored,
which may be as fatal. The castle of Guido da Polenta,
husband of Francesca da Rimini and brother of Paolo, is
now ruined, but a cypress on a plateau of the grounds is
still called Francesca's cypress.</p>

<p>It was about this era that the Comacines began their
many emigrations, and spread throughout Italy. The
church-building Longobards, being subjugated themselves,
had no longer the power to employ them, so this large guild
had to look further afield for their work.</p>

<p>Hitherto they seem to have been almost exclusively employed
in the Lombard kingdom and its dukedoms, except
the few who went to England and Germany in the seventh
century. But Charlemagne had a wider rule in Italy; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
good architecture was needed in other parts. Some documents
quoted by Professor Merzario<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> not only prove these
travelling days of the <i>Magistri</i>, but connect them with
many of the finest and most interesting churches in Central
and South Italy. One is a deed of gift for the weekly
distribution of bread and wine to the poor at Lucca in 805.
It begins&mdash;"Ego Natalis, homo transpadanus, magister
casarius, Christo auxiliante, ædificavi Ecclesiam in honori
Dei et Mariæ et B. Petri Apostoli, intra hanc civitatem"&mdash;"I,
Natalis, a man from beyond the Pò, being a master
builder, by Christ's help have constructed within this city, a
church in honour of God, of Mary, and of the blessed apostle
Peter."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Here we see the Comacine Master settled as leading
architect in Lucca, far from his native land beyond the
Pò, and so flourishing that he can dispense large charities.
He seems to have done some public works too; there was
a canal called the Fossa Natale, which ran through the
city, and had a bridge over it. There must have been
others of the guild in Lucca, before Natalis, working
at the churches of S. Frediano and S. Michele.</p>

<p>The latter building was not long prior to the era of
Magister Natalis. It was founded in 764 by the Lombard
Teutprandus or Iutprand, and his wife Gumbranda. It coincides
with S. Frediano in its plan of the Latin cross. Here,
however, we find no Roman capitals, as in S. Frediano, but
the twelve columns which sustain the arches of the nave are
of rough white marble, from the neighbouring mountains of
Carrara. They are of the same size upward, not narrowed
at the top. The capitals are of somewhat composite order,
with a leaning to Orientalism. The eight columns in the
nave have simple arches <i>a sesto intero</i> (semi-circular) springing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
from them; the four which support the tribune are
heightened by piers of a Gothic form, flanked by pilasters,
which raise the arch over the central nave. This seems to
be the first instance of an attempt to render the sanctuary
of the high altar more grand and majestic than the rest of
the building. The façade is of quite a different epoch, and
has nothing to do with the interior. It was the work of
Guidectus in 1188, who also built the cathedral of Lucca.</p>

<p>The windows show the same divergence of style. In
S. Frediano they are large and classical, in S. Michele
narrow and Neo-Gothic.</p>

<p>The other document is less decisive, but has its
significance. An ancient mediæval <i>Memoriale</i>, in the
monastery of Pontida,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> has the following entry&mdash;"Guglielmo
de Longhi di Adraria built the church of San
Giacomo di Pontida, employing Magister Johanne de
Menazio et multis aliis de episcopatu comensi." This was
finished in 1301, and was consequently later than the
building of S. Zeno at Pontida, of which another MS. in
the same monastery relates a fact, which the chronicler
says happened <i>avanti il mille</i> (before the year 1000).</p>

<p>"A master very famous in the art of building, who
came 'de regione juxta lacum cumanum' (from the region
about Lake Como), met with robbers at Cisano, as he
returned from Verona to his native place. The which
Master being struck with terror, recommended himself,
calling with all his heart on the blessed Zeno, and made a
vow that if the saint brought him safe and sound out of
that deadly peril, he would build a church in his honour.
As soon as he had spoken the words, the horse on which
he was mounted took fright and galloped away, so that the
robbers could no more harm him. Thus he escaped safely
with all his belongings ('potè scampare sano con tutte le
sue cose'), and returning the following year with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
workmen, he began the building of the church of S. Zeno
at Valle Ponzia (now Pontida), the people of the neighbourhood
lending him aid, both in money and in labour."</p>

<p>We may be excused for jumping at conclusions if we
opine that as he was returning from Verona after a long
sojourn, he had been employed there. Probably it was at
the church of S. Zeno; particularly as he felt he had a
special claim on the help of that saint.</p>

<p>There is very little left of the first church of S. Zeno
at Verona (which was rebuilt entirely in the twelfth
century), except the curious mausoleum in the crypt, which
is supposed to be King Pepin's tomb. Our Comacine who
escaped the brigands may possibly have made that, as the
era (before the year 1000) corresponds. Or he might have
been working at the church which Bishop Lothaire, aided
by Bertrada, mother of Charlemagne, built 780 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and
dedicated to S. Maria Matricolare, and which the Bishop
Ratoldo (802-840) chose as the cathedral. Of this, too,
little remains now, it having been rebuilt in the twelfth
century, but some indications of the old building were
found in the excavations made in 1884. At the depth of
two metres, in the Lombard cloister adjoining it, a mosaic
pavement was discovered with a design of foliage, animals,
and inscriptions. There was also a fallen column, which
they were able to stand on its own base with its capital.
Cattaneo<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> thinks that these are the remains of Lothaire's
church, as the capital of the column is undoubtedly of the
eighth century. It has a rigid abacus, and the form is
rudely Corinthian, with solid straight leaves curled back,
instead of the usual acanthus. The same style is seen
in S. Salvatore of Brescia, and S. Maria in Cosmedin in
Rome, both Comacine works.</p>

<p>Another Carlovingian church in Verona is that of S.
Lorenzo, said to have been founded by Pepin. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
interesting bits of its primitive architecture remain, and are
precious relics. There is, for instance, a little spiral stairway
in the wall, which led to different divisions of the
women's gallery.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>At this era a change in the form of windows may be
observed; they were narrowed and heightened, a first step
towards the Gothic form.</p>

<p>In Carlovingian times the Comacines worked much in
Rome. Cattaneo<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> says that there exist letters from Pope
Adrian I. to Charlemagne, begging him to send architects
(<i>Magistri</i>) from the north of Italy, to execute some works
in Rome. Now these <i>Magistri</i> could be no other than the
Comacine Guild of Lombardy, who with the Longobards
had lately become subjects of Charlemagne, and were
without doubt the finest builders in Italy, if not monopolists
of the art. The buildings which they designed and erected
in Rome at that time were the churches of S. Maria in
Cosmedin, S. Lorenzo in Lucina, S. Saba on Mount
Aventine, and the residence of the Patriarch near S. John
Lateran. The door of a chapel in S. Prassede with its
Comacine <i>intrecci</i> is a standing proof of their work there in
the ninth century.</p>

<p>Anastasius, the librarian, gives an account of the
rebuilding of the church of S. Maria in Cosmedin.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> He
says that Adrian found it absolutely beneath a pile of ruins
(<i>sub ruinis positam</i>) of a former temple to Ceres and
Proserpine, which literally hung over it. As this mass of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
ruin prevented the enlargement of the new church, it was
entirely demolished "by fire, and by the labours of the
people." The space being cleared, a new and spacious
Basilica was erected "a fundamentis tres absides, in ea
constituens."</p>

<p>The writer mentions this form with three apses as
being new in Rome. We have, however, seen that
in the north of Italy the Comacines had been, for the past
century or two, building Basilican churches on precisely
this plan. In fact the three round apses had become one
of the special marks of their churches. Cattaneo argues
that the form came from the East, as some of the Syrian
churches of the fifth century and the great Basilica of
St. Simeon Stylites at Kaiat Senian, erected in 500, have
signs of the same conformation. Whether these were of
absolutely Oriental origin, or the result of some early
emigration of the <i>liberi muratori</i>, archæologists must judge.
The two rows of columns which divide the nave from the
aisles, have solid piers of masonry interposed between each
three columns; these are elongated above the colonnade to
support the roof, and strengthen the upper gallery.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the Comacines availed themselves of
old material in this work; the columns are of all species
and styles, some fluted, some smooth, some with antique
Corinthian capitals, others of Comacine work. One is
of the same form as those we have described in S. Maria
Matricolare at Verona, with solid volutes, placed perpendicularly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
instead of the graceful acanthus. The same
capital is seen in S. Agnese fuori le mura.</p>

<p>There is in S. Maria in Cosmedin a very interesting
fragment of the Comacine decoration of the time when
Adrian I. was the patron of the guild. It is a bit of
cornice, formed of a little colonnade of round arches;
beneath it an inscription in a curious early style, the letters
all sizes and shapes. It runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"DE DON IS D&#864;I ET S&#864;CE D&#864;I GENETRICIS MARIÆ.
TEMPORIBUS DO&#862;NI ADRIANI PAPE EGO GREGORIUS."</p>
</div>

<p>I have seen another fragment during the recent
restorations. A fine <i>intreccio</i> on a marble slab in one of
the pulpits, which had been reversed and inlaid on the
other side in thirteenth-century mosaic.</p>

<p>The church of S. Saba on Mount Aventine, which was
also built under Adrian I., has every mark of Comacine
work, especially in the mediæval and unclassic form of
capitals. Probably the supply of ancient capitals fell short
after the building of the other churches, and the builders
had to supply them with their own chisels. They made
a rude imitation of the Ionic form, as far from the classic
grace of the original, as their plain hard volutes were from
the elegance of the Corinthian.</p>

<p>A better artist seems to have been placed by the
Comacine Guild in S. Lorenzo in Lucina, which was
contemporary to this. The capitals of the same form are
much more clearly and firmly cut, and in a better style of
ornamentation. Here too are the Comacine lions, now built
into the wall under the square lintels of the door. Of the
Comacine work in the house of the Patriarch near S. John
Lateran, <i>i.e.</i> the papal residence of those times, not much
remains to show the hand of the Comacines, except the
sculptures on the well in the cloister, the parapet of
which is adorned with two zones of reliefs, divided by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
interlaced band. The under one consists of alternate
crosses and rude palms, the upper is a row of round arches,
adorned with upstanding volutes, like vine-tendrils; under
one arch is a dove with grapes in his beak, and in the
other a cross. There are also two sculptured stones in the
same cloister, one showing various interlaced patterns, the
other a cross formed by weavings of the continued line,
enriched in the groundwork of foliage.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting churches of the Carlovingian
era is that of San Pietro in Grado near Pisa.
In the Middle Ages this was a great shrine for pilgrimages,
being, it is said, built on the spot on which St. Peter first
set foot in Italy. (<i>Gradus</i>&mdash;a step.) Legend (supported
by the assertion of a certain Archbishop Visconti, who
preached in Pisa in the thirteenth century) says that the
Apostle Peter was driven ashore at that spot, and having
made an altar he began to baptize&mdash;giving his disciples
commands to build a church there. What the first church
was like is not known; the present one was built between
600 and 800 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and was decorated with frescoes before
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000. There is a great similarity in structure between
this building and that of S. Apollinare in Ravenna; they
are both of similar brick masonry, and three-apsed, and
the aisles are in about the same proportion to the greater
height of the nave. The proportions of the short round
arches on the tall classic columns of the interior are extremely
similar, as is the scheme of ornamentation, with
the difference that at Ravenna the medium is mosaic, and
at S. Pietro a Grado it is fresco. The line of Bishops
in the spring of the arches in Ravenna is reproduced at
Grado by a line of Popes in medallions, ending with Leo
III., 795, which would probably mark the era of the
foundation of the church.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>San Pietro, however, has one very great peculiarity. It
has no façade, but is built with the usual Lombard three
apses at one end, and a single semi-circular tribune at the
other. The only door is at the side. The priest, who
is naturally proud of his church, and learned in its history,
told us that by this peculiar form the builders wished to
represent a ship, and pointing out the great square pilasters
that break the line of columns at the fourth arch from the
west, he showed how the raised poop of a vessel was
expressed by the greater height and width of the four
arches at the west end. Certainly the narrowing effect
being towards the chancel instead of the reverse, is most
remarkable.</p>

<p>I was not, however, convinced by his symbolism, and
realizing the greater proportions of the west end, where
three arches with fluted columns stretched across a tribune,
now turned into an organ-loft, I felt convinced that the
present form was not the original. Either the ancient
altar once stood at the west end, and the church, like
so many Lombard ones, had formerly faced the opposite
way; or else the semi-circular tribune, which seems to
be of later work, has been added by restorers, to cover
in the three arches of the ancient façade. That, in fact,
the large solid pilasters in the nave marked the ancient
wall of the interior, and the four arches on the other
side of them formed the narthex. To support the first
theory, is the fact that the altar called St. Peter's altar
stands now isolated in that west end, and the canopy in
the form of an ancient Lombard <i>ciborium</i> stands on four
columns above it, carved in stone in very early style. The
opposite theory of the narthex having been at that end,
may on its side be confirmed by one of the frescoes, the
last but two on the south wall, which represents the church
itself as it was prior to <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000. Here the artist has,
with a curious mediæval disregard of perspective and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
possibility, represented both ends of the church in one
view, and here we see plainly the three apses with their
marble perpendicular ribs on one side, and the façade of
large arches with a row of smaller ones across the building
above them on the other. I leave the question of this
puzzling west tribune to wiser judges than myself, and
trust that some new Fergusson, Hope, or Street may
some day discover the truth.</p>

<p>The columns of the nave are all of antique marble,
the ruins of a Roman temple to Ceres at Pisa; some are
of cipollino, others Oriental granite, one is of fluted white
Greek marble. The capitals are mostly antique and classical,
though a few show the hand of the early Comacine
in their straight upstanding volutes. The ingenuity of
the <i>Magistri</i> in making use of old material is shown in
the various devices by which these columns are adapted.
Where they are too short the base is raised on two
pedestals; where too small for the massive pillar, a wide
abacus is placed on the top to support the arch. One
of the columns which support the altar is made long enough
by a base made of an antique carved capital reversed
beneath it. We have a distinct sign of the Comacines in
a stone let into the wall near the door, and which evidently
formed part of the ancient architrave. It is carved in an
intricate interlaced knot. I shall speak in the chapter on
Comacine painting, of the frescoes in the nave, which are
unique of their kind, and of deep interest to the Art
historian.</p>

<p>These churches of the Carlovingian era in Italy cannot
be documentally proved to have been at all connected with
Charlemagne himself, except that he sent the <i>Magistri
Comacini</i> to Rome, at Pope Adrian's request. The same
cannot be said of the great church of Aix-la-Chapelle, with
which his name must be for ever united, but which is
certainly not entirely unconnected with this Lombard Guild.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Where history gives no precise information, and where
authors, ancient and modern, fail to fix the precise era of
this important work, it is of course impossible to say who
was the architect. We can only judge by the style, and
by inferences drawn from previous works of the same style.
First, as to the few facts we are able to gain: Eginbertus,
a Lombard, the biographer of Charlemagne, in his <i>De vita
et gestis Caroli Magni</i>, Capit. 26, tells us that Charlemagne
"built the Basilica of Aquisgrana of wonderful beauty, and
adorned it with much gold, silver lamps, and with gates
and doors of bronze. For this construction, not being able
elsewhere to find columns and marble, he provided that
they should be brought from Rome and Ravenna." This
fact, of a want of proper material in France, would seem
to imply that skilled workmen to build in stone must have
been imported with the material. It is difficult, or indeed
impossible, to prove that French workmen were equal to
the occasion, by showing other contemporary works in
France. Any churches they may have then had, have
long since perished, for at that date they were usually built
of wood; another argument that France could not have
supplied accomplished architects in stone.</p>

<p>Some say the church was designed by Ansige, Abbot
of Fontanelles, others give the credit to Eginhard, or
Eginbertus, as his Lombard name is spelt; but as he
does not claim it for himself in his writing,&mdash;indeed, we
see from the above extract that he speaks quite impersonally
of it,&mdash;there is certainly no documentary evidence
to prove this assertion. Speaking dispassionately, it
would be strange for a man of letters, private secretary
to a great king, to suddenly develop into a full-fledged
architect. It is much more likely that as he was a Lombard,
he was interested in employing the builders whom all his
countrymen had employed for centuries. D'Agincourt,
who had a good deal of <i>amour propre</i>, and would, if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
could, always give glory to France, says (vol. i. p. 27,
139)&mdash;"It is natural to believe that the Italian architects
whom Charlemagne had brought with him, designed the
buildings they made for him in France, on the lines of
those of their own country." Dartein, in his <i>Lombard
Architecture</i>, writes of it&mdash;"If we inspect the octagonal
half-domes which terminate the centre of the cross in
S. Fedele at Como, we see that they reproduce the rotunda
of Aix-la-Chapelle. The form of the shafts, the outline of
the wall, and the disposition of the collateral vaults are
alike in both edifices. The similarity is so great as to
prove imitation, especially as other churches in the Rhone
district remind one of churches in the territory of Como."
The fact of similitude is significant, but is it not more
likely that the imitation was the other way? S. Fedele,
or S. Eufemia as it was first called, was built in S. Abbondio's
time, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 440, before the era of the Longobards,
and we are told is the only church of that time which
retains its original architecture, especially in the rounded
apse. The similarity would then go to prove what has
been an hypothesis, that Charlemagne really brought
builders as well as marble from Italy, and that the <i>Magistri
Comacini</i> were those builders.</p>

<p>The church has also been compared to S. Vitale at
Ravenna, but the Comacines were accustomed to build
circular churches, such as the Rotunda at Brescia, and
others. They were generally used as baptisteries or
mausoleums; in fact were ceremonial churches.</p>

<p>Aix-la-Chapelle was designed as the tomb of Charlemagne,
and here the builders mingled the rotunda of the
ceremonial church with the basilica for worship. The
workmanship is much more rude than that of S. Vitale,
where Greek artists were employed. It is easy to distinguish
the parts added by the Comacines, from the classical and
Byzantine imported adornments furnished by the spoils of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Rome and Ravenna. The Italians were not left entirely
free in their designs, but had to conform to a more northern
climate and different national taste; the windows were
narrowed and elongated, and the pitch of the roof raised to
a sharper angle. As Pliny had said to Mustio, his Comacine
architect, seven centuries before&mdash;"You Magistri
always know how to overcome difficulties of position," and
Charlemagne's architects, in an equal degree, studied both
climate and position. The further we go south or east the
roofs have a tendency to flatten, the further we go north
they have a tendency to rise into sharper gables. The
cause is this, I take it&mdash;a climatic one. Where there is
much rain or snow, the sloping roof is a necessity; therefore
this first indication of pointed architecture, as adaptable
to the northern climate, makes Charlemagne's church an
interesting link between the Romano-Lombard and Gothic
in the north: just as Romano-Lombard stands between the
classic and Romanesque in the south. If Ansige suggested
these modifications to the Italian builders, he had a
wider office in the history of art than he knew; for Aix-la-Chapelle
became the root from which the French and
German so-called Gothic sprang; improved in the first
instance under the hands of the <i>Franchi-Muratori</i>, who
in the succeeding generations were called to work on
churches in both countries. After all, the first step was
but a slight one, being more a raising and narrowing of the
round arch than the innovation of the pointed one. It
might stand better as a first indication of the stilted
Norman arch.</p>

<p>Of the civil architecture of the Carlovingian era we
have very few instances remaining. The Emperor Charlemagne
built no especial palace for himself, but used that of
Luitprand at Milan, which in Charlemagne's time was
known as <i>Curtis domum imperatoris</i>. An old chronicler
tells us that he fortified Verona. He says&mdash;"In the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
when King Pepin was still young, the Huns or Avars
invaded Italy. When Charlemagne heard of their approach
he caused Verona to be fortified, and walls erected all
round, with towers and moats; and with <i>pali fissi</i> fortified
the city to its very foundations, leaving there his son Pepin."
Forty-eight towers rise from these walls, of which eight are
very high, the others well raised above the walls. These
must have been what the old writer quaintly called <i>pali
fissi</i>.</p>

<p>A diploma of Ludovic II., dated 814, proves that the
walls of Piacenza also date from this era. It is in favour
of his wife Analberg, giving her permission to incorporate
a part of the walls into a monastery. It runs&mdash;"Of our
own authority, we add to the monastery and give in perpetuity,
all the <i>steccato</i>, internal and external, of the said
wall of the city, from the foundations to the battlements,
as much as extends from Porta Milano to the next
postern gate; and not only this, but also the <i>macie</i> (rubble)
which is found round the walls and ante-walls, and the same
of the towers, gates, and posterns."</p>

<p>The use of hospices is much connected with Carlovingian
times; they came in when the Church ruled, and
pilgrimages became the fashion. The first hospices were
in monasteries. In 752 S. Anselmo founded one for
pilgrims at Nonantola, in Agro Mutinense. The council
of Aquisgrana (Aix-la-Chapelle) made decrees as to the
establishment of hospices, and Charlemagne made laws on
the subject, "ut in omni regno nostro, neque pauper perigrinus
hospitia denegare audeant." To the ordinary fine
for homicide, Pepin II. added sixty soldi more if the person
killed were a pilgrim. One who denied food and shelter
to a pilgrim was fined three soldi. These humane provisions,
like all such, soon became abused; so many non-religious
people travelled on pilgrims' privileges, that at
the end of Charlemagne's reign it was found necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
to provide real pilgrims with a <i>Tessera trattoria</i> to prove
their authenticity.</p>

<p>Among the earliest hospices might be mentioned the
leper hospital founded in Classis near Ravenna in S.
Apollinare's time, and one in Rome, founded by the
Roman lady Fabiola for destitute or abandoned sick and
poor. In 785 a certain Datheus, arch-priest at Milan,
founded an <i>exonodochio</i> (home for destitute children), and
Queen Amalasunta built a foundling hospital at Ravenna,
in the sixth century. Charlemagne commanded that there
should be a place in the peristyle of the churches for the
reception of foundlings. The Loggia del Bigallo, though
a later building, is a beautiful specimen of such a peristyle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br /><a name="ChapVI" id="ChapVI"></a>

IN THE TROUBLOUS TIMES</h3>

<p>After the Carlovingian dynasty had withdrawn from
Italy, the country had two or three centuries of troublous
times, in which very few people thought of church-building,
and if the Comacine Masters found work in their own land,
it was more the building of castles and strongholds in their
most solid <i>opera gallica</i>, than the sculpturing of saints or
the rearing of gorgeous basilicæ.</p>

<p>After the Carlovingians came the House of Berengarius,
which held the Italian throne from 888 to the intervention
of Otho I. of Germany in 951. During this time there
was always a military fermentation going on; Duke Guido
of Spoleto fighting Berengarius; Arnolph and his son
Sventebald fighting Guido; the Hungarians overrunning
and sacking Italy on the north, where there were battles
at Brenta, Garigliano, Firenzuola, and bloodshed generally
till the murder of Berengarius.</p>

<p>Nor were things more peaceful in the south. Between
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 924 and 950 the Saracens invaded Sicily, and having
established themselves there, assaulted Rome, and marched
on towards the Alps.</p>

<p>In Central Italy the Dukes of Burgundy, Provence, and
Bavaria were found contesting with Lothaire for the succession.
At length, in 951, Otho came down from
Germany and scattered them all, restoring comparative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
peace for a time, though an arbitrary one; but it did not
last long.</p>

<p>Next came superstitious fears; the poor battered
Italians, demoralized by fierce human foes, succumbed
entirely to the moral subjugator, superstition. They were
firmly persuaded that the year 1000 should be the end
of the world, and every activity, public and private, was
paralyzed. It was only after that era had passed, and
found Italy still existing, that new life began to stir in its
inhabitants. Of course, fighting still continued, but these
were holy wars&mdash;the Crusades, of which Urban II. preached
the first in 1096. Then the art of sculpturesque architecture,
which is the handmaid of religious enthusiasm,
began to revive, and the Comacine Masters again had
palmy days.</p>

<p>But they had not been entirely idle during these warlike
times. Prof. Merzario says<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"In this darkness which extended over all Italy, only
one small lamp remained alight, making a bright spark in
the vast Italian necropolis. It was from the <i>Magistri
Comacini</i>. Their respective names are unknown, their
individual works unspecialized, but the breath of their spirit
might be felt all through those centuries, and their name
collectively is legion. We may safely say that of all the
works of art between <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 800 and 1000, the greater and
better part are due to that brotherhood&mdash;always faithful and
often secret&mdash;of the <i>Magistri Comacini</i>. The authority and
judgment of learned men justify the assertion."</p>

<p>Here Prof. Merzario quotes several of these <i>uomini
dottissimi</i>. First, Quatremal de Quincy, in his <i>Dictionary
of Architecture</i>, who, under the heading "Comacine,"
remarks that "to these men, who were both designers and
executors, architects, sculptors, and mosaicists, may be
attributed the renaissance of art, and its propagation in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
southern countries, where it marched with Christianity.
Certain it is that we owe it to them, that the heritage of
antique ages was not entirely lost, and it is only by their
tradition and imitation that the art of building was kept
alive, producing works which we still admire, and which
become surprising when we think of the utter ignorance
of all science in those dark ages." Our English writer,
Hope, taking their later appellative of Lombards, credits
Lombardy with being the cradle of the associations of
Freemasons, "who were," he says, "the first after Roman
times to enrich architecture with a complete and well-ordinated
system, which dominated wherever the Latin
Church extended its influence from the shores of the Baltic
to those of the Mediterranean."<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> We will omit the witnesses,
Kugler of Germany and Ramée of France, and
take the Italian great authority, Pietro Selvatico.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> He
notes that art in Europe, from the seventh to the thirteenth
century, consisted of a combination of Byzantine
and Roman elements, but in the ninth century a third
element mingled, which had in itself so much that was
original, as to constitute an independent style. "This," he
goes on to say, "was the Lombard or Comacine architecture,
as it is called, which is distinguished by its low-pitched
roofs, its circular arches, rounded on columns,
which assimilate to the Greek and Roman styles. This
gained a certain systematic unity after the first half
of the ninth century." Prof. Selvatico seems to have
ignored all the Comacine architecture under the Longobards,
who were certainly the nurses of the guild, and
takes it up just when it was freeing itself from the bonds
of superstitious tradition, <i>i.e.</i> the transition between Roman-Lombard
and Romanesque.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_111"><i>See page 111.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>No doubt the genealogy of the style was this. First,
the Comacines continued Roman traditions as the Romans
continued Etruscan ones; next, they orientalized their style
by their connection with the East through Aquileia, and
the influx of Greek exiles into the guild. Later came a
different influence through the Saracens into the South,
and the Italian-Gothic was born.</p>

<p>The Comacine art of the interregnum after Charlemagne
may be judged by the church of S. Zeno at
Verona. This had been rebuilt in 810 by King Pepin,
whose palace was in Verona. His church fell a prey to
the devastation dealt by the Huns in 924, and Bishop
Rothair restored it in the tenth century, the Emperor Otho
the First furnishing the funds. There was a third restoration
in 1139, when the present front and portico were added.
The general form of Otho's church still remains, and shows
the usual "three naves" (emblematical of the Trinity), and
the circular arches supported by alternate columns and
pilasters. The roof, as in all the older Lombard churches,
was of wood, and not vaulted. It is not recorded whence
Otho obtained his architects, but though no names are
written, the Comacine mark is there. Later restorations
have wiped out most of the old signs, but they have left us
some capitals on the columns and the reliefs on the arches
leading into the crypt under the tribune. Two of the
columns are here illustrated. In one may be seen human
figures clinging to palm-branches, by which the Magister
who carved it symbolized man clinging to Christ. The
other is a veritable Comacine knot, formed of mystic winged
creatures, with their serpent tails entwined. On the arches
of the crypt are a wealth of mediæval imaginings, mystic
beasts, Christian symbols, scriptural characters and ancient
myths, all mingled together as only a Freemason of the
Middle Ages could mingle them. Otho's architects were
certainly <i>Magistri</i> of our guild, and probably our friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
from Pontida, who called on S. Zeno to save him from the
brigands, was one of them.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that later Comacines put the elegant
façade to the church in 1139, when Magistri Nicolaus and
Guglielmus carved the wonderful porch with its columns
resting on lions, and its very mediæval reliefs, in which we
see Theodoric, King of the Goths, going straight to the
devil in the guise of a wild huntsman. On the architraves
are allegorical reliefs of the twelve months. But this front
is not of the era we are now discussing, and we shall mention
it again.</p>

<p>A work which is indubitably of the ninth century, and
has all the marks of the time, is the atrium of S.
Ambrogio at Milan, which was a commission to Magister
Adam of the Comacines, by Anspert of Bissone, who was
Archbishop of Milan from 868 to 881. The atrium of a
church was anciently used for the catechumens, as they
were not admitted into the body of the church till they
were baptized. The atrium of S. Ambrogio is a square
space surrounded by a portico composed of columns supporting
round arches. The proportions are so fine and
majestic that it is looked on as the best mediæval edifice
existing in Lombard style. The capitals are composed of
foliage, strange ornaments, and groups of grotesque animals
and monsters rudely sculptured; and yet with the imperfect
chiselling there is such a freedom of design and wealth of
imagination as you find in no Byzantine work, however
precise its execution. We give an illustration of one of its
capitals. The Comacine <i>intreccio</i> is there, but floriated
and luxurious. The significance of these sculptures, though
unintelligible to us, is believed to be the occult and conventional
art language of the Comacines or Freemasons.
On the doorway, among the foliage and symbolic animals,
one may still read the name of "Adam Magister."</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_112"><i>See page 112.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Another very important church of the ninth century is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the cathedral of Grado, near Venice, which had been first
built between 571-586, seemingly by Byzantine artists,
though they also used old classical capitals from former
buildings. The plan of this Basilica in its older form
shows very clearly the leaning to one side which we have
said was a symbol of Christ's head being turned in pain on
the Cross. Here not only the left aisle reaches higher up
than the right, but the wall of the façade slopes considerably.
In the ninth century Fortunato, Patriarch of Grado,
who lived about 828, sent for <i>artefici Franchi</i><a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> to restore
the Baptistery of S. Giovanni on the island which was
the metropolis of maritime Venice. Now what were these
<i>artefici Franchi</i>? It is clear they could not have been
French, for Charlemagne himself had to get builders from
Lombardy, his own country not having as yet enough skill
in masonry. It is natural to suppose they were the guild
from Cisalpine Gaul, which though composed of Italians
had been styled "Lombards" while under the Lombard
kings, and may have been "Franchi" while the Carlovingian
kings ruled. They were known as "Tedeschi" when later
they were under the protection of the German emperors,
a term which puzzled old Vasari greatly. It is still a
question whether the real interpretation would not be the
literal one, Free-masons, who may well have been recalled
from France where they were at work.</p>

<p>The wording of a phrase in the will of the Patriarch
Fortunato, where he says "<i>feci venire magistros de
Francia</i>," shows plainly that he referred to architects belonging
to a guild in which the higher orders were called
<i>Magistri</i>.</p>

<p>Having begun to work at Grado, the Lombards were
evidently employed in other Venetian churches. Their
style is said to be very evident in the Duomo of Murano,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
but how much they did, and whether they worked with
Eastern or other architects, will, I suppose, never be
precisely known.</p>

<p>A curious little church of this epoch is existing in almost
its original form at a village called Abadia, near Sesto
Calende on Lake Maggiore. It has a crypt and a portico,
three naves and three apses.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The crypt is supported on
round arches and small thin columns, the roof is of wood.
The portico has three arcades resting on columns and
pilasters with capitals of Lombard-Byzantine style.</p>

<p>We find the guild at work not only in the north, but in
the south of Italy at this epoch. One of the famous buildings
in South Italy with which the Comacine Masters were
connected, is the celebrated monastery of Monte Cassino
with its church. This monastery had been built in the first
instance by a Brescian named Petronax, who made a
pilgrimage to Rome to see Pope Gregory II. The Pope
urged Petronax to go to Monte Cassino where St. Benedict
was buried. He went and there was inspired to found a
monastery.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the eleventh century this had been
much ruined by the Saracens and others, and Desiderius its
abbot, in 1066, decided to restore it. He was of the race of
the Lombard Dukes of Beneventum, was a friend of Pope
Gregory VII., and became his successor on the papal throne
under the name of Victor III. Desiring that his church
should be a very "majestic temple," he sent to call artificers
from Amalfi and from Lombardy.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Among the Italians
was a certain Andrea, from Serra di Falco, near Como, a
fine worker in metal, who, with his disciples, made the
bronze doors.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>Some interesting baptisteries were erected in the tenth
century by the Comacines. The baptistery at this time
seems to have had a set form&mdash;the octagon; and a mystical
significance, that figure being highly symbolical of the
Trinity, being formed by a conjunction of three triangles.
In the earlier days of the Romano-Lombard style, the
baptistery generally had only a small arcade, or row of
brackets supporting arches round the outer wall beneath the
roof, and a practicable gallery round the interior. Of this
shape was the Florentine Baptistery, that of Como and
many others.</p>

<p>When the later Comacines worked in more florid
Romanesque style, the Baptisteries were often covered
with little galleries or rows of colonnettes like those of Pisa,
Parma, Lucca, etc.</p>

<p>A fine specimen of Lombard work of about 1000 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, or
a little later, which shows the approach towards a more
Gothic style, may be seen in the cloister of Voltorre, a little
walled town on Lake Varese. The cloister of Voltorre is
thus described&mdash;"The beauty of this eleventh-century
Lombard building is singular. The four sides are formed
of porticoes which sustain the upper storey. The porticoes
facing the open court are formed on one side of small graceful
arches in brick, with friezes and reliefs sustained by elegant
colonnettes, some round and some octangular, with capitals
of various forms. On two other sides the colonnettes are
smaller and shorter, but still graceful; they terminate in
varied and bizarre capitals surmounted by a kind of bracket
on which the large stones of the upper building rest.
Among the sculptures of the little columns on the left as
one enters the court, is incised in mediæval characters and
abbreviations the following&mdash;'<i>Lanfrancus magister filius
Dom. Ersatii de Livurno</i>.'" Livurno most probably stands
for Ligurno, a place a few miles from Voltorre. So our
master Lanfranco Ersatti, having graduated in the Comacine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Guild, set himself to embellish his native place. In 1099
Magister Lanfranco designed the Duomo of Modena, which,
as will be seen hereafter, was the work of centuries, he
being followed by a long series of architects.</p>

<p>Then came more troublous times for the Comacines in
their own country. From 1118 to 1127 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> the republic of
Como was at fierce war with the Milanese. A long poem
by a Comacine poet, quoted by Muratori, describes the
workmen and artisans fighting in the streets in their working
dress, and wielding any tool or weapon they could find.
The masons and builders worked as sappers and miners, dug
the trenches, built up barricades, and destroyed the enemy's
houses and castles. One of these brave citizens, named
Giovanni Buono, is especially mentioned by the ancient
poet, and he is peculiarly connected with the Comacine
Masters as the first of a long line of <i>Magisters</i> of the Buono
family. He forms a tangible link between the half-traditional
Comacines of Lombard times, and the more clearly defined
guild of the Romanesque epoch. From that to the Italian
Gothic period their identity is traceable by documents. A
warlike bishop, Guidone, was the leader of the Comacines,
but after three years' war he fell ill, and on his death-bed
prophesied the fall of his fatherland.</p>

<p>The Comacines were indeed at the end of their resources,
they were exhausted of means, of food, and of warriors; and
after several victories at length fell under the power of the
Milanese, becoming a tributary state. But it was not till
Milan had called in the aid of several other cities that brave
little Como succumbed to her on August 27, 1127. She
was not enslaved even then, and must have retained her
political freedom, for we find her siding with Frederic
Barbarossa in 1167, against the whole Lombard League, to
her cost, for she was a great sufferer in the battle of
Legnano on May 29, 1176.</p>

<p>Barbarossa tried to make some compensation, by ceding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to Como the castles of Baradello and Olona. A coin exists,
of the Como mint of that time, with an eagle and <i>Imp.
Federicus</i> on one side, and <i>Cumanus populus</i> on the other.
Frederic had reason to cultivate the Comaschi, for they sent
200 ships to the Venetian war for him. An edict of
Barbarossa's in 1159, and another dated 1175, shows that
he allowed the Comacines to rebuild their walls and city at
that date, <i>civitatem in cineres collapsam funditos re ædificavimus
nos</i>. This occupied them a long time. The tower
towards Milan bears the date of 1192. The round tower
that of 1250. There were eight gates in these new walls.

<h3 >CHAPTER I<br />

THE NORMAN LINK</h3>

<p>The great building guild of the Middle Ages had
another connection with France, independently of Charlemagne,
and one which perhaps left a more lasting impression
on the nation than the church of Aix-la-Chapelle. It
was through the Normans, who held a prominent place
in the history of Romanesque art, some authors giving
them the credit of its introduction into Italy.</p>

<p>This may be, but between the tenth and twelfth centuries
architecture and sculpture underwent so many transformations
and became mingled with so many different
elements that its history is most difficult to disentangle.
There was a maze of different influences brought together
in Sicily, such as Norman, solid and heavy, from the north;
Byzantine, set and precise, from the east; Saracenic, warm
and fanciful, from the south&mdash;all mingling together in the
temples of Monreale and Palermo, where I think we may
add a fourth and Italian element, in the Comacines or
Lombards.</p>

<p>The first consideration is: How did the Norman architecture
first arise? Was it indigenous? Did the Normans
about the tenth and eleventh centuries suddenly begin
building round-arched and pillared churches from their own
inner consciousness?&mdash;for all histories assure us there were
no stone Norman-arched buildings before the tenth century,
and that by 1150 the pointed style had already begun to
supersede it. All the great and typical examples are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
crowded into the last fifty years of the eleventh century, at
which time the Norman dukes were very powerful. It was
a time of enterprise and excitement of all kinds, not the
least of them being the rage for church-building, awakened
by the early missionaries.</p>

</div>

<p>Some light may be thrown on the way the round arch
first got into Normandy, by the following bits of old
Norman chronicles, which show that a very important
event took place in the history of the Comacines at the
end of the tenth century, connecting them in a remarkable
and suggestive manner with the rise of Norman architecture.
We find from old chronicles that S. Guillaume,
Abbot of S. Benigne in Dijon, was a Lombard, born in 961
on the island of Santa Giulia, in Lago di Orta, part of
Lago Maggiore. He was the son of a certain Roberto,
Lord of Volpiano; Otho the Great himself had been
his godfather at the time when he besieged the island, and
took prisoner Willa, wife of King Berengarius. Guillaume
(William) was, as his friend and biographer, Glabrius
Rodolphus, tells us, "of a keen intellect, and well instructed
in the liberal arts." In his youth he travelled much in
Italy, and was often at Venice, where he formed a close
friendship with Orso Orseolo, Patriarch of Aquileja. The
Patriarch Orso was at that time engaged in the restoration
of the church of Torcello, one of the gems of architecture
of the age; while his brother, the Doge Otho Orseolo,
was pressing forward the works of S. Marco at Venice.
It was here probably that S. Guillaume was interested in
the Masonic guild, and recognizing its power as an aid to
mission work, would have joined it. He founded the
famous monastery of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria in Piedmont,
and towards the end of the tenth century he went to France
with the venerable Abbot of Cluny; here he decided to
build a monastery to S. Benigne in Dijon, which he himself
designed. But to effect his design he had to send to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Italy, his own country, for "many people, men of letters,
masters of divers arts, and others full of science."<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The
chronicler goes on to say that Guillaume displayed much
wisdom in bringing these masters (<i>magistri conducendo</i>) to
superintend the work (<i>ipsum opus dictando</i>). These two
phrases are identical with those of Article 145 in the Edict
of Rotharis, and I think might be equivalent to a proof
that the Italians who built S. Benigne at Dijon were indeed
of the Comacine Guild. The chroniclers further tell us that
the Abbot Guillaume was invited to Normandy by Duke
Richard II., to "found monasteries and erect buildings."
The very phrase implies his connection with, and command
of architects. He at first refused, because he had heard
that the Dukes of Normandy were barbarous and truculent,
and more likely to deface than to erect sacred temples; but
afterwards he decided to go. He stayed there twenty
years, founding forty monasteries, and restoring old ones,
which were in those days chiefly built of wood. "He had
many of his Italian monks trained to continue the work he
had begun. These propagated such love and taste for
art in those rude and bold Normans, that stone buildings
multiplied there, and when William of Normandy conquered
England, the style passed over with him." Hope,
whose judgment is unerring on all subjects connected with
the Lombard style, confirms this. He says<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> that some time
before the style came into England, Normandy had given
remarkable models of a <i>tutto-sesto</i> (round-arched) or Lombard
style, and that the same precedence is noticeable
in the pointed or composite style. Indeed, the English
owe to the Normans the erection of many fine edifices of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
both kinds. Thus some gave the name of Norman to the
Gothic buildings and others gave it to Lombard ones, and
it was imagined that the pointed arch came originally from
Normandy. And yet Normandy was one of the stations
of pointed architecture in its pilgrimage towards us from
the south. As an illustration and convincing proof of this
pedigree of Norman style from the Lombard, we may give
one of our oldest so-called Norman churches, that of St.
Bartholomew the Great at Smithfield, London. The
original nave has vanished, but the tribune remains,
divested, it is true, of the two great piers in front of the
apse, which were removed in 1410. The semi-circle of the
apse has, however, been replaced in the old style; and,
with its pillared arches and ambulatory, harmonizes well
with the ancient part, now the nave, which is perfectly
Lombard. The ambulatories below, and the women's
gallery, such as we find in St. Agnes at Rome, and many
Comacine churches, both have a distinctly Italian origin.
Even the stilted arches in the choir only seem in their
outline like magnified Lombard windows. The masonry
is the true Comacine style, great square-cut blocks of stone,
smoothed and fitted with exact precision; while the windows
of the triforium are clearly a four-light development of the
two-light Lombard window, divided by its small column;
the very form of the column is identical, though it lacks
the sculpture. Probably the Italian artists were few, and
English assistants not yet trained. The clerestory was
a reflex of a later style, being added in 1410, to replace
the so-called Norman one, which no doubt had the usual
round-arched windows with a column in the centre. Indeed,
I think it would be worth the while of archæologists to find
out whether the whole church were not originally built by
Italian architects, as Rahere, its founder, was in Rome on
a pilgrimage, when he fell very ill of fever, and vowed to
build a hospital if he recovered. He soon after had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
vision of St. Bartholomew, who instructed him to return to
London, and build a church in the suburbs of Smithfield.
He founded both the church and hospital of St. Bartholomew
in about 1123. There seems to me to be such a difference
between this church and other more heavy Norman contemporary
buildings, that it might be suspected Rahere
followed the older example of St. Wilfrid and St. Benedict
Biscop, and brought over the Comacines with him.</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot agree with Mr. Fergusson in his assertion that
the members of the early Freemason guilds were only
masons, and never designed the works entrusted to them,
but always worked under the guidance of some superior
person, whether he were a bishop or abbot, or an accomplished
layman. Certainly the architects who worked for
the Longobards must also have sometimes given the
design, or what do the words <i>opus dictando</i> mean in the
Edict of Rotharis? Surely Theodolinda could not have
been architect enough to draw the plan for Monza. Nor
do I think that the word <i>Magistro</i> in the masonic or any
other art guild, applied to mere masons or underlings, but
to those who were so far masters of their craft as to direct
others, and make a working plan for them. The bishop or
abbot, or educated layman, might have formed his own
idea about the style he wished his building to take, and
have made a sketch of it; but the practical working plan
would have been drawn by the Magister, who directed his
workmen or <i>colligantes</i> to put it into execution.</p>

<p>It is true that many ecclesiastics were, like the monks of
S. Guillaume at Dijon and other Dominicans, members of
the Masonic guilds, and were accordingly versed in the
science of architecture. In that case the monk, when he
became bishop or abbot, might furnish a plan, and very
often did so. Fra Sisto and Fra Ristori built Santa Maria
Novella in Florence; but they were connected with the
Florentine lodge, so their doing so would certainly be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
proof that the Masters of the guild could not have done
equally well themselves.</p>

<p>That the oldest churches in Normandy have a great
affinity to Lombard buildings is evident on examination.
See the Lombard-shaped windows in the towers of St.
Stephen's at Caen; the exterior of the circular apse of
St. Nicholas, Caen, which still keeps its original hexagonal
form, with pilasters like slight columns running from ground
to roof at each division, and a colonnade surrounding it of
perfect Lombard double-arched form, with a small pillar
in the centre of each. (<i>See</i> Fergusson's <i>Architecture</i>.)</p>

<p>The local Norman developments are equally well
defined in this building; the usual little Lombard gallery
beneath the roof has given way to large, deep, circular-headed
windows, and the roof has taken the high pitch
natural to the climate. Both of these are climatic distinctions;
the northerner aiming at more light, the southerner
trying to shut out the sun: the damp climate, of course,
necessitated the sloping roof.</p>

<p>Now, before the Normans came back to Italy they had
made Italian architecture their own, and impressed on it
their own character, rugged and robust, and it was so
different to the buildings in South Italy with which they
have been accredited, that I think this theory will have to
be revised. The arts were certainly not influenced in
Sicily by the first Norman invasion in 1058 under
Roger I., son of Tancred, he being entirely a bellicose
and rough warrior. It was when the Normans had taken
root there, had become more softened, and had formed a
settled government; in fact, after Roger II. had been
crowned King of Apulia and Sicily in 1130, that they
began to give their minds to artistic architecture. This
was a century and a half after Abbot Guillaume took his
countrymen over to build at Dijon. The first stone of the
Duomo of Cefalù was laid in 1131, and the royal palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of Palermo begun during the next year. Under Roger's
successors the fine churches of Martorana, and the cathedral
of Monreale in 1172, the cathedral of Palermo (1185),
and the palace of Cuba arose. An Italian writer, La
Lumia, is very enthusiastic over the Duomo of Monreale&mdash;"that
visigoth (<i>sic</i>) art which had in Normandy
erected the cathedrals of Rouen, Bayeux, etc., multiplied
in Monreale the ogival forms which had been known and
practised in Sicily since the sixth century,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and took its
upward flight in towers and bold spires. In the mosaics
and decorations the majestic Arabic art espoused Byzantine
and Christian types. The varied and multiplex association
has impressed on these works an <i>impront</i> both singular and
stupendous. The columns show the ruins of pagan classicism,
the incredible profusion of marbles, verd-antique, and
porphyry speak of a rich and florid political state; while
the solemn mystery of those sublime arcades, profound lines
and symbolic forms; the dim religious light, the ecstatic
figures of prophets and saints with the gigantic Christ over
the altar offering benediction to men, all shadow forth the
mediæval idea of Christianity&mdash;full and ingenuous faith,
vivified by conquest."</p>

<p>Then he goes on grandiloquently to say&mdash;"The names
of the builders are unknown to us, and we need not trouble
to seek them: a generation and era is here with all its
soul made visible, with all its vigorous and fruitful activity."</p>

<p>But if we cannot find the names it would at least be
interesting to know whether the Norman-Siculo architecture
were entirely the work of the Normans or not.
Gravina, Boitò, and other Italian writers think that the
Normans took a similar position in Sicily to that of the
earlier Longobards in the north, <i>i.e.</i> that they were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
patrons, and employed the artists whom they found in
Sicily.</p>

<p>Merzario,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> giving as his authority Michele Amari,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
brings forward as a suggestive fact, that precisely at the
time of the Norman occupation, there was a large emigration
into Sicily of members of the Lombard or Comacine
Guild. Amari thinks that the feudal government of the
Normans at that time did not allow their subjects to emigrate
from land to land (excepting of course their armies
for purposes of conquest), while in North Italy feudalism
was going out, and with the establishment of republics the
movement of the inhabitants was freer. "This," he says,
"accounts for the so-called colonies of Lombards, which
came to Sicily at that time, but of which, unfortunately, we
have no reliable historical evidence."</p>

<p>These Lombardo-Siculan colonies, however, have been
clearly traced by an Italian writer, Lionardo Vigo, in his
<i>Monografia critica delle colonie Lombardo sicule</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> He has
proved that there were four Lombard colonies in Sicily.
That the first went down with Ardoin and Mania, between
1002, when, on Otho's death, Ardoin was elected King of
Italy, and his retirement to S. Benigno in 1013 after his
long struggle with Henry II. The second was during
the Norman conquest of Sicily in 1061; the third later in
the century, at the time of the union of the Norman
and Swabian dynasties; and the fourth about 1188 under
the Emperor Frederic,&mdash;this colony was led by Addo di
Camerana.</p>

<p>The first two colonies left no lasting traces in the
island, but the third founded the town of Maniace, and the
last planted a settled colony which has left its mark, not
only in the language, but in the many Lombard place-names.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Thus there are in Sicily villages named Carona,
Gagliano, Novara, Palazzolo, Padernò, Piazza, Sala, and
Scopello, all of which are names of older places in the
Comacine territory. Another name, "Sanfratelli" (the
holy brethren), is very suggestive of the patron saints of
the Lombard Guild, the "Quattro Incoronati." It is in
this district precisely that Signor Vigo finds a special
language, which has no affinity with Sicilian, or central
Italian, and which he describes as a "hybrid, bastard
language; a decayed Longobardic, only intelligible to those
who use it; a frightful jargon and perfectly satanic tongue."</p>

<p>In the same volume of the <i>Archivio Storico Siciliano</i>
is another collection of documents, regarding an episode
of the war between the Latin and Catalonian factions at
Palermo in the time of Ludovico of Aragon, about 1349.
It shows in a list of volunteers, several names of <i>Magistri</i>
which seem to be familiar to us. Here is Magister Nicolao
Mancusio, Magister Guillelmo, Magister Nicolao de
Meraviglia, Magister Chicco, Magister Juliano Guzù,
Magister Roberto de Juncta (Giunta), Magister Vitalis, both
from the Pisan lodge, Julianus Cuccio, Salvo di Pietro, etc.
We find that Benedictus de Siri, a Lombard, was paid for
twenty soldiers for ten days. Again on July 31, 1349, among
the payments made to those who fought to defend Vicari
during the siege, we find Magister Vanni di Bologna, Paulo
de Boni, Magister Gaddi, Magister Benedicto de Lencio
(Lenzo near Como), and Johanni de Gentile, and various
others, all mixed up with ordinary folks who have no
magic <i>Master</i> before their names. This seems to imply
that the Lombard colony at that time had been long
enough in Sicily to be nationalized, and that they furnished
men for the war like any other citizens.</p>

<p>In some cases the payments are made to the heirs of
Magister Johanne or Vitale, thus proving them to have
become possessed of property. This was a privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
accorded to the Comacine Masters even in feudal times, when
other classes were bound and enslaved. From the example
of Magister Rodpert, the Longobard who sold his land at
Toscanella many centuries before, we judge that when the
Comacine remained long in a place, he made use of his
earnings to buy land. Indeed in those days when no banks
existed, landed property was the only secure disposition for
wealth. And having bought his house and vineyards, it was
but natural that he should name the estate after his own
native place in Lombardy.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to find these direct proofs of the constant
presence of the Lombard Masters in Sicily during
the whole Norman and Swabian dynasties. It accounts for
so much. It accounts for the so-called Norman architecture
in Sicily having so much more affinity to Italian forms
than to French-Norman; and it accounts for the Saracenic
cast which Lombard architecture took after that era. The
influence was a lasting one, and showed itself in all the
subsequent work of the guild, during the eleventh and
twelfth centuries.</p>

<p>Was this influence imbibed by the Normans who are
said to have caused it? Evidently not.</p>

<p>Was Norman architecture proper, in the north of Europe,
immediately changed? Not at all. It remained the same
through all the Norman rule from Robert Guiscard to the
fall of the line. It was not till the thirteenth century that
the elegant pointed Gothic found its way into England&mdash;but
not through Normandy&mdash;and took the place of the
solid round-arched, short-pillared buildings introduced by
William the Conqueror. We have seen that this round-arched
style was first taught the Normans by the Italian
builders whom the Abbot Guillaume brought northward
with him.</p>

<p>But the Lombard influence in France was not confined
to Normandy nor to Aix-la-Chapelle. Hope, the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
authority on Lombard architecture, who spent eight years
studying European churches, finds many a sign of Lombard
handiwork on French soil. At Tournus is an abbey
church of extremely interesting Lombard form. Fergusson<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
thus describes it&mdash;"Its antiquity is manifested by the
rudeness both of its design and execution. The nave is
separated from the aisles by plain cylindrical columns
without bases, the capitals of which are joined by circular
arches at the height of the vaults of the aisle. From the
capitals rise dwarf columns supporting arches thrown
across the nave. From one of these arches to another is
thrown a tunnel vault which runs the cross way of the
building, being in fact a series of arches like those of a
bridge extending the whole length of the nave." Here we
have, I believe, the first step towards the vaulted roof of
the later Gothic buildings. The church of Ainay at Lyons,
is said by Fergusson to be very similar to this.</p>

<p>Then there is the cathedral of Avignon in Provence,
with its octagonal cupola, and its porch of Charlemagne's
era in Romano-Lombard style. It is not unlikely that the
earliest Provençal churches were built by Italian architects,
for Avignon was closely connected with the Papacy at that
time, and the Popes as we know were the especial patrons
of the Masonic guild.</p>

<p>In the church of S. Trophime at Arles we have distinct
signs of the Comacines, in the lion-supported columns of the
central porch, and the frieze of sculpture above. There are
three richly-sculptured porches; the central door is divided in
two like a Lombard window, by a slight column which rests
on kneeling figures, and has angels carved in the capital.
The richly ornate architrave has lions on each side of it.</p>

<p>The church at Cruas in Provence has three apses with
Lombard archlets round them all. Its dome is surrounded
by a colonnade, and a superimposed round turret with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Lombard windows. The tower has the usual double-arched
windows.</p>

<p>Provence shows some beautiful specimens of Italian
cloisters, at Aix, at Arles, and at Fontifroide. The latter has
a row of arches supported by double columns of elegant
slightness, and with foliaged capitals of varied form and
great freedom of design. Fergusson says that the freedom
and boldness are unrivalled. The cloister at Elne is still
more varied and unique; the capitals mix up Egyptian,
classic, and mediæval art in a manner truly unique.</p>

<p>As for towers, those left in Provence show a distinctly
Lombard style. The tower at Puissalicon near Beziers is
perfect in every particular, with its pillared Lombard windows
increasing in width and lightness as they ascend.</p>

<p>From Provence, the land of the Popes, the Comacines
penetrated further into France. The church of S. Croix at
Bordeaux, attributed to William the Good, Duke of Aquitaine,
who died in 877, has its round-arched porch, decorated with
a profusion of Comacine <i>intrecci</i> of intertwined vines; and
spiral pilasters grouped at the angles. Hope quotes the
façade of the cathedral of San Pietro at Angoulême, as the
finest Lombard one existing. There are numerous files of
round arches, on elegant little columns, statues in niches,
rich bas-reliefs, friezes, and arabesques. The nave is divided
into three portions, each with a cupola. In this we see
another step forward towards the vaulted roof. At Tournus
the arches are simply thrown across the three divisions of
the nave; here they are arched into the shape of a dome.
The tower is entirely Lombard in form. There are Lombard
churches at Poictiers, Puy, Auxerre, Caen, Poissy,
Compiègne, etc., in all of which the style is perfectly
distinct from the Norman, as it was then developed; and
also from the later Gothic.

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

THE GERMAN LINK</h3>

<p>The heading of this chapter implies nothing that can
impugn the claims of the Teutons to the perfecting of the
Gothic style, which claims are undoubtedly fair. It only
implies that the pointed Gothic architecture was not an
invention of the Germans, so much as a national development
of some earlier form; and, like all developments,
must have had some link connecting it with that earlier
source. Was the Comacine Guild that link? Legends and
traditions pointing to it are many, but, as usual, absolute
proofs are few. Some proofs might be found if, with a clue
in one's hand, search could be made among the archives of
the German cities in which round-arched Lombard-style
churches were built before the pointed Gothic and composite
style came in. Some German <i>savant</i> should sift out
certain traditions, which, from want of authorities and
unfamiliarity with the language, I am not able to do.
These are&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly: That St. Boniface came to Italy before proceeding
on his mission to Germany in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 715, and that Pope
Gregory II. gave him his credentials, instructions, etc., and
sent with him a large following of monks, versed in the art
of building, and of lay brethren who were also architects, to
assist them.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This is the precise method in which St.
Augustine and St. Benedict Biscop were equipped and sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
to their missions in England, and S. Guillaume to his
bishopric in Normandy. What resulted in England from
the missions of St. Augustine, St. Wilfrid, and St. Benedict?
The cathedral of Canterbury, the abbeys of Hexham,
Lindisfarne and others&mdash;all distinctly Lombard buildings.
What did S. Guillaume do in Normandy? He built
the churches of Caen, Dijon, etc., also in pure Lombard
style, not in the heavier Norman by which the natives
followed it. So in Germany we hear that among the
bishoprics founded by St. Boniface were Cologne, Worms,
and Spires,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> precisely the cities which have remains of the
earliest churches in Lombard style. There are many
other German churches, now fine Gothic buildings, whose
crypts and portals show remains of older round-arched
buildings.</p>

<p>Secondly: It is necessary to discover the precise
connection of the Emperors Charlemagne, Otho, and the
German monarchs who successively ruled in Lombardy,
with the Masonic guild there. Whether, as they employed
them in the Italian part of their kingdom, they did not also
employ them across the Alps.</p>

<p>Thirdly: To find out whether, when Albertus Magnus
went back to Cologne from Padua, he had not become a
<i>Magister</i> in the Masonic guild, as many monks were,
and whether he propagated the tenets of the brotherhood
in Germany.</p>

<p>Certain proof exists that he designed the choir of the
cathedral there, if nothing more. He also wrote a book
entitled <i>Liber Constructionum Alberti</i>, which afterwards
became the handbook for Gothic work. It is probable
that this was in great part borrowed from an earlier
Italian work on the construction of churches, named
<i>L' Arcano Magistero</i>. This, however, was a secret book of
the guild, and was kept most strictly in the hands of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
<i>Magistri</i> themselves. Kügler relates that in 1090 a citizen
of Utrecht killed a bishop, who had taken <i>L' Arcano
Magistero</i> away from his son who was an architect. I am
strongly of opinion that Albertus Magnus was much
connected with the importation of Freemasons into
Germany.</p>

<p>Fourthly: To discover whether in the cities where
great buildings went on for many years, there remains any
trace of the same threefold Masonic organization, which we
find in the Italian cathedral-building towns; and whether
the administration thereof was jointly managed by the
<i>Magistri</i> or head architects, and the patrons or civic
authorities of the city in which the buildings were
carried on.</p>

<p>All these things can only be verified, in case the works
of contemporary chroniclers still exist, or if there remain
any traces of archives of so early a date.</p>

<p>As far as style in building goes to prove anything, the
Lombards certainly preceded the native Gothic architects
in Germany. Hope enumerates several churches, such as
those at Spires, Worms, Zurich, and several old ones at
Cologne, built before or about the Carlovingian era, which
have every sign of Lombard influence.</p>

<p>The Gross Münster of Zurich was begun in 966 as a
thank-offering of the Emperor Otho for his victories in
Italy, and its plan, arches, windows, towers (excepting only
the climatic addition of the pointed roofs) are all in
Lombard style. The cloister adjoining it is very Italian,
with its double columns and its sculptured capitals. Now,
as Otho granted a special charter to the Masonic guild of
Lombardy, it is natural to suppose that when he wanted a
church built, he would employ this valuable class of his
new subjects. At Basle we have a distinct sign of the
Comacine Masters in the <i>intrecci</i> and other symbols
sculptured round the <i>Gallus-pforte</i> of the cathedral, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in the crypt are two carved lions which were once beneath
the columns of the door. They were removed in the restoration
of the cathedral, after the earthquake of 1356.
These lions are precisely the counterparts of those in the
doorways of Modena and Verona. But it is at Cologne,
the city of Albertus Magnus, that the Lombard style is unmistakable.
Can one look at the three apses of the
churches of the Apostles and of St. Martin, with the round
arches encircling them, and little pillared galleries above,
or at the double-arched windows in the towers, without at
once recalling the Romanesque churches of Lucca, Arezzo,
and Pisa, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries?<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Santa Maria del Campidoglio at Cologne, which was
founded by Plectrude, wife of Pepin, has the same Lombard
galleries running round the apses, and Cunibert's church
in its western door shows not only pure Comacine sculpture,
but the characteristic lion of Judah between the column
and the arch. S. Andrea and S. Pantaleone, both founded
in 954 by Bishop Bruno, brother of Otho the Great, were
in the same style. This group of buildings all in one
city, and all founded under the Emperors who ruled in
Italy, surely suggest that when Charlemagne took over the
builders for Aix-la-Chapelle, they as usual left their school
and <i>laborerium</i> there, and that Otho and his successors in
their turn had not far to go for architects.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_137">See pages 137</a> and <a href="#Page_257">257</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>If their churches are not enough, the civil architecture of
that epoch also affords proof of Lombard influence in Germany.
Compare the windows and style of the ancient
dwelling-house at Cologne which Fergusson illustrates,
p. 590, with those of any Lombard building whatsoever,
from the Palace of King Desiderius in the eighth century
to the Bargello of Florence in the thirteenth, and you will
find them identical. The only German innovation is in
the high gabled roof. Again, compare St. Elizabeth's home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the Castle on the Wartburg, with the ancient Communal
Palace at Todi, or at Perugia, or other Lombard building
of the twelfth century, and its genesis will at once be seen.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Ferd. Pitou, author of the fine monograph on the
Cathedral of Strasburg, confirms the presence of Italian
builders in Germany, not only in the time of the Carlovingians
and the line of Otho, but also in the later times of
the Swabian dynasty. He says, when speaking of the
works at Strasburg, that "colonies of artisans, chiefly sent
from Lombardy and other parts, where church-building
was prevalent, accompanied the monks and ecclesiastics
who directed the work. These spiritual leaders, however,
had all the glory of the buildings up to about the end of
the twelfth century, when ogival architecture arose. These
Lombard colonies pushed on beyond the Rhine, to the
Elbe, the Oder, and the Vistula, and even penetrated to
the forests and lands of Sarmatia and Scythia."</p>

<p>There seems little doubt that the German lodges founded
by the Comacine emigrations took root, and became in time
entirely national. Traditions are many, and most of them
point back to Italy. For instance, legend says a brotherhood
of stone-carvers existed in Spires and Bamberg from
the time when those cathedrals were begun. Others say
that Albertus Magnus on his return from Padua formed
the first Masonic association in Germany, making special
laws and obtaining especial privileges for the immense
number of builders he collected to put into execution his
cathedral at Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Again, L' Abbé de Grandidier,
writing to a lady in November 1778, tells her that he has
discovered an ancient document three centuries old, which
shows that the much-boasted society of the Freemasons
is nothing but a servile imitation of an ancient and humble
confraternity of real builders whose seat was anciently in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Strasburg. Hope, however, says that the Strasburg lodge,
which was the earliest acknowledged German one, was first
recognized by a legal act executed at Ratisbon in 1458,
and that the Emperor Maximilian ratified and confirmed
the act by a diploma given at Strasburg in 1498.</p>

<p>My theory is this, that in their early emigrations the
Comacine Masters founded the usual lodges; that the
Germans entered their schools and became masters in their
turn; that in the end the German interest outweighed
the foreign element in the brotherhood, and the Germans,
wishing to nationalize an art which they had so greatly
developed, split off from the universal Masonic Association,
as the Sienese builders did in Siena in the fourteenth
century, and formed a distinct national branch: that this
decisive break probably took place at Strasburg, and that
other lodges followed suit and nationalized themselves in
their turn. No doubt some German searcher into archives
may arise, who will do for Cologne and Strasburg what
Milanesi has done for Siena, and Cesare Guasti for Florence,
and so throw light on the complicated organization of
patrons, architects, builders, and sculptors which banded
together under one rule, to build the multiplex and grand
old cathedrals.

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
THE ORIGIN OF SAXON ARCHITECTURE (A SUGGESTION)<br />
BY THE REV. W. MILES BARNES<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></h3>

<p>Wherever the Romans planted colonies, there they
established <i>Collegia</i>; without its colleges Roman society
was incomplete; the <i>Collegium</i> was an element essential to
Roman life.</p>

<p>The <i>Collegium</i> was a corporation or guild of persons
associated in support of a common object; there were
colleges of artists, of architects, builders, and artisans, as
well as colleges associated with the administration and
government, with religion and law.</p>

<p>The <i>Collegium</i> consisted of <i>Collegæ</i> or <i>sodales</i> (fellows,
as we should term them), with a president who was
styled "<i>Magister</i>"; the <i>Collegium</i> was recognized by the
State, which confirmed the regulations made by the
members for the government of their body, provided they
were in conformity with the laws of the land. There is
evidence that Roman <i>Collegia</i> were established in Britain
shortly after its conquest by the Romans, and there was
certainly a <i>Collegium fabrorum</i> in Britain in the reign of
Claudius, the first Roman emperor to whom the island
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
was subject. Under the direction of the Roman college,
the Britons as builders reached a high degree of excellence
in their craft, "so that when the cities of the empire of
Gaul and the fortresses on the Rhine were destroyed,
Constantius Chlorus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 298, sent to Britain for and
employed British architects in repairing and re-edifying
them" (<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. ix. p. 100).</p>

<p>Mr. Coote affirms that <i>Collegia</i> existed here after the
final departure of the Romans from the island, and that the
Saxons found them here, and did not interfere with them.
Now if <i>Collegia fabrorum</i>, which certainly existed in
Britain throughout the Roman occupation, were still in
existence during the Saxon occupation, it needs explanation
why the earliest missionaries to the Saxons had to bring
or to send abroad for workmen to build churches.</p>

<p>On the Continent the barbarians who overran Italy
dreaded the influence of the <i>Collegia</i>, and vigorously suppressed
them, prohibiting them everywhere under the
hardest penalties; under such circumstances we can understand
that the societies in Rome could scarcely escape
observation, and we shall be prepared to hear that the
college of architects and builders in that city removed from
thence and took refuge elsewhere. According to tradition
they settled at or near Comum, where in mediæval times,
under the title of Comacine Masters, they gained fame
as architects, and their services were in much request
throughout the Continent and beyond it. Had the barbarians,
however, treated the Roman colleges with the
same indifference as the Saxons are reputed to have
shown towards them in England, all guilds of artists and
artisans must, for a time at least, have ceased to exist, or
have removed from Rome, where there was no longer any
appreciation of art, or demand for their services.</p>

<p>It is true there is no documentary evidence to prove
the continuous existence of the <i>Collegia</i> from Roman to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
mediæval times, or to show that the Roman college, which
removed to Comum, was identical with the Comacine Guild
which emerged from the darkness which shrouds the
history of those early times;&mdash;there is, however, such
evidence as can be derived from the similarity of the
institutions, in their aims and constitutions. In the latter
institution even the title of <i>Magister</i> was retained, though
the use of the term was no longer limited to the president
of the body, every competent and fully instructed member
of the society was admitted to the order of <i>Magistri</i>,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>&mdash;possibly
because these members formed the governing body&mdash;and
the president became a Grand Master. The members
generally were called <i>Liberi muratori</i>&mdash;Freemasons&mdash;because
they were not subject to the sumptuary and
other laws which regulated the work and pay of ordinary
workmen.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Comum, which possessed all the privileges of a Roman
<i>municipium</i>, stood at the head of Lacus Larii&mdash;the Lake of
Como&mdash;on the northern shores of which, from Como to
the island of Comacina, P. Strabo and C. Scipio settled
Greek colonies, which Julius Cæsar added to and consolidated.
The names of villages on these shores of the
lake are still some guide to its extent and limits. Comum
was made the chief seat of the colony.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Empire, this Romano-Greek colony
seems to have withstood the attacks of the barbarians, and
preserved its independence for a long time. At the time
of the invasion of Italy by the Longobards, the whole of the
northern end of the lake was in the hands of the imperial
(Byzantine) party, and it was not until the year 586 that
the island of Comacina fell into the hands of the Longobard
King Autharis, though the lake and country northwards of
the island seem to have still continued under imperial rule.
The country around Comum, therefore, remained in comparative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
quiet, and if much progress in art was not possible,
there at least it did not become altogether degenerate.</p>

<p>The Greek influence was evidently strong in the colony.
Even the bishop in the latter end of the fifth century was
a Greek, for S. Abbondio, who died Bishop of Comum in
489, had previously held the bishopric of Thessalonica;
possibly other bishops of that diocese were of the same
nationality: it would be surprising if the Roman architectural
college, which took refuge there, had been altogether
unaffected by it, particularly as the Romans derived
their knowledge of architecture as well as of art from the
Greeks, and Greek architecture was at all times treated by
the great Roman architects with respect, as we learn from
Vitruvius; besides, with the fall of the Empire, all progress
in Roman art had ceased, and Byzantium was the quarter
to which men looked for instruction in Christian and secular
art.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> It could only be that the work of a Roman society
of architects in the midst of a Greek colony would show
marked traces of Byzantine influence, and none the less
because in all probability there were Byzantine societies
of a similar kind beside it.</p>

<p>Müller says, after the fall of Rome, Constantinople was
regarded as the centre of mechanical and artistic skill, and
a knowledge of art radiated from it to distant countries.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Let us turn our attention now to Britain. The Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
chroniclists relate that Pope Gregory in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 598 sent over
the monk Augustine to convert the British, and with him
several of the fraternity of <i>Liberi muratori</i> (Freemasons),
so that the converts might speedily be provided with
churches, oratories, and monasteries; also that Augustine,
in 604, despatched the priest Lorenzo and the monk
Pietro back to Rome with a letter to Pope Gregory,
begging him to send more architects and workmen, which
he did.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> We shall presently see, that although Bede does
not say in so many words that Augustine was accompanied
by architects and builders, yet that is the only inference
which can be drawn from his words, and from Pope
Gregory's instructions to Mellitus.</p>

<p>It was a common practice in mediæval times for missionaries,
whether bishops or monks, to have in their train
builders and stone-cutters, and they themselves were often
skilful architects. St. Hugh of Lincoln was not the only
bishop who could plan a church, instruct the workmen, and
handle a hod.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Even female saints appear to have included in their
retinue, persons who were capable of building churches,
though the followers of St. Modwen,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> who, on landing in
England from Ireland about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 500, left her attendants
to erect a church at Streneshalen, near the Arderne
forest, while she went to visit the king, may have been
only capable of building in wattle-work or in wood, "of
hewn oak covered with reed," "after the manner of the
Scots." Bede (iii. 25) describes the church of Lindisfarne
as "a church of stone," that material not being usual
amongst the Britons (iii. 4); still it is one instance among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
many, of the prevalence of the custom for missionaries,
whether priests, monks, or nuns, to take in their train on
their missionary journeys workmen experienced in building,
and to employ them where necessary to build churches for
their converts.</p>

<p>Professor Merzario states, on the authority of ancient
MSS., that the architects and builders sent were <i>Liberi
muratori</i>. Now, the members of the Comacine Society
were known and are described in ancient MSS. under that
title; besides, what other guild would Gregory be likely to
invite to send members to join the mission?&mdash;were there
indeed any other building guilds existing at the time,
except the Byzantine societies. It is certainly not probable
that Gregory would have invited Greek <i>etairia</i> to send
members with the Roman mission, to build churches "after
the Roman manner," which is what the first builders in
Saxon England did, and in preference to builders belonging
to a society which was of Roman origin, and held all the
traditions of the Roman school of architecture.</p>

<p>But without the record of the Italian chroniclists it
would have been clear to any careful reader that architects
accompanied Augustine, and other early as well as the
late missionaries to England. The first evidence will be
found in Bede (i. 26), where it is stated that after King
Ethelbert had been converted to the faith, the missioners
built churches and repaired old Romano-British churches
in places whither they came, for their converts to worship in.</p>

<p>And again (i. 30), Gregory instructs Mellitus not to
destroy the idol temples, but if well built to cleanse them
and put altars in them, and convert them into churches.
Gregory states that he decided on this course after mature
deliberation; which shows that Gregory knew that many
of the old Roman temples were still in use, and that
Mellitus had with him architects who were qualified to carry
out the necessary repairs to them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_208" id="i_208"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fiesole Cathedral Interior.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Again, in 601, Pope Gregory sent Paulinus and others
to assist Augustine in his work, and by them he sent sacred
vessels, ornaments for the church, and vestments. Now
experienced architects and builders to build churches for
the converts were as necessary as the ornaments wherewith
to furnish them, and it is fair to conclude that this essential
had not been overlooked, and that there were with those
who brought the ornaments, men competent to erect the
churches to place them in. Indeed it seems possible that
Paulinus himself may have graduated in the Comacine
school of architecture; it is a curious fact that he is spoken
of under the title of <i>Magister</i>,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the title given to fully-instructed
members of that order, and we know that many
monks were amongst the enrolled members of the Comacine
body.</p>

<p>The strongest evidence, of course, would be the
evidence of his work as a builder; unfortunately very
little of that remains&mdash;though the little we know about it
is consistent with the fact that either he was of that order,
or he had Comacine Masters with him. The Whalley
cross which is attributed to him is ornamented with that
peculiar convoluted ornament which is found in early
Comacine work; and he was certainly a great builder of
churches, of the precise type which the Comacines would
have built at that time. Bede relates that he built in
Lincoln a stone church of beautiful workmanship, in which
he consecrated Honorius, Bishop of Canterbury, in the
place of Justus. The "beautiful workmanship" implies an
experienced architect. Bede who thus describes it was
a competent witness, and in all probability he knew the
church, which was in his time roofless. Again, King Edwin
under the direction of Paulinus built a "large and noble
church of stone" at York (ii. 14). At this time the Comacine
builders had not begun to build in the style which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
was afterwards known as the Lombard or Romanesque
style, and of which indeed they were the authors, and this
church seems to have been an Italian Basilican church with
an atrium at the west end as was customary in churches
of the period; this particular atrium being built round the
little wooden oratory which Edwin had put up when under
the instruction of the bishop, before his baptism, the oratory
being in the midst of the open court.</p>

<p>The Basilican church of the period has been so often
described that it will not be necessary to give a detailed
description of it. It generally consisted of a nave, with
two aisles separated from the nave by arcades; at one end
(sometimes at both) the building terminated in an apse,
of which the floor was raised; this raised floor in later
times projected into the nave and was protected by a
railing.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The altar was in the centre of the string of the
arc of the apse, and round the arc were seats for the
clergy, the bishop's throne being in the centre, in the place
which would be occupied in a Roman heathen Basilica by
the presiding magistrate. Beneath the raised floor of the
apse was the <i>confessio</i> or crypt, in which the body or
relics of the saint to whom the church was dedicated were
deposited. Plans of several Saxon crypts still remaining in
England will be found in Mr. Micklethwaite's valuable paper
in the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, New Series, vol. iii. No. 4.</p>

<p>At a little later period a further change was made;
on the floor of the nave from the chancel westward a
space was divided off by a low screen, in each side of
which was a <i>bema</i> or pulpit; from which the Gospel and
Epistle were read, and the services sung by the Canonical
singers.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> A very complete screen of a little earlier date
than St. Augustine may still be seen in the church of
San Clemente, Rome; the ancient church from which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
was removed is underneath the present church; westward
of the church was the atrium, an open court surrounded by
a colonnade; the atrium seems to have been used in some
British churches for the canons, who had cells round it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_211" id="i_211"></a>
<img src="images/i_211.jpg" width="491" height="374" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">S. Clemente, Rome. Interior showing ancient screen.</span></p>
</div>

<p>St. Cadoc early in the sixth century built a church in
Lancarvan monastery, which monastery he rebuilt; each
of the thirty-six canons had a residence <i>in atrio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> the
residence being probably a cell with a door opening into
the atrium, such as may still be observed in some old
monastic cloisters on the Continent. There is evidence
of an atrium at the west end of Brixworth church, and
the construction of the basements of the towers at
St. Mary, Deerhurst, at Monkswearmouth, and Barton-on-Humber,
seems to show that there was a similar construction
at the west end of those churches.</p>

<p>The church of S. Ambrogio, Milan, possesses an atrium
built by the Comacines, but it is of much later date, and
would therefore afford a general idea of an early Saxon
church atrium only in plan.</p>

<p>Though we have little ornament of the early Saxon
period, and that little is mainly limited to the ornamentation
on early Christian crosses and fonts, it is clearly of the
same character as Comacine work. The convoluted ornament
on Paulinus' cross at Whalley has been noticed; similar
work may be seen on the Kirkdale cross, Bewcastle and
Ruthwell crosses, Crowle and Yarm crosses, and others
in England and Ireland. On the Bewcastle and Ruthwell
crosses there are stiff flower convolutions with birds and
beasts on the branches. Collingham cross has interlacing
monsters, and on others are panels sculptured in representation
of Scripture subjects and characters. Some of
these crosses are decorated with another and very mark-worthy
ornament, consisting of bands of interlaced work.
These bands are sometimes of a single strand, but more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
frequently of three strands. An interlaced ornament of this
kind was found on the Corinthian base of a column in the
church of S. Prassede in Rome. On comparing these interlaced
patterns and convolutions with the carving on the
ambo in the Basilica of S. Ambrogio, Milan, which is
Comacine work, it will be seen how nearly they correspond;
whilst the ornaments and sculptured figures in the façade
and round the portals of the doors of S. Michele, Pavia,
an early Lombard church of the eighth century, show
treatment similar to Saxon work. It appears to me
possible that this façade has been rebuilt presumably
about the twelfth century, but there can be little doubt
that the carvings as well as a considerable portion of the
church itself are of the earlier date.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>All the crosses above-mentioned bear Runic inscriptions
upon them, but on examination it will be seen that
these inscriptions are generally by another hand, and of
ruder workmanship than the carving of the crosses. Sometimes
they are little more than scratches, and in one,
namely, the Yarm cross, a panel was evidently left by the
carver for the inscription, which was afterwards cut upon
it, but being too small, the last two lines had to be compressed
to be got into the space. In the Kirkdale and
Lancaster crosses, the runes are certainly inferior in workmanship,
and they seem to have been an afterthought.
The borders on which they are cut do not appear as if
they were originally intended to bear them.</p>

<p>The date of the fragment of the Yarm cross is fixed
by the inscription, if it has been correctly read, being
dedicated to Bishop Trumberht, Bishop of Hexham, who
lived towards the close of the seventh century.</p>

<p>The ornament on Saxon fonts, not being so well known,
would require illustrations beyond the scope of this article,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
to render remarks upon them intelligible. One instance
may, however, be given of the similarity of ornament
in early Italian and Saxon carving. Both the Saxon font
in Toller Fratrum church, Dorset, and the well-head (of
the eighth century) at the office of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Rome, are decorated with precisely similar patterns.
Interlacing bands in three strands, bordered by a cable
moulding, encircle the top of each. Similar ornament will
be found in Saxon MSS. of the eighth century in the
British Museum Library, as in <i>Evangelia Sacra Nero</i>, d. 4.</p>

<p>Besides the ornament on the ancient crosses and fonts,
which clearly belongs to the Saxon period, there are in our
churches fragments of ornament which in all probability
are of that era.</p>

<p>The angel carved in stone, built into the north wall
of Steepleton church, near Dorchester, may have formed
part of the tympanum of the doorway of the Saxon church.
Floating angels with their robes and legs bent upward from
the knee, precisely similar in treatment to the Steepleton
angel, may be seen in illuminations in Saxon MSS. in the
British Museum. I have examined them, but have mislaid
my references to the press-marks. And in the Museum
of the Bargello at Florence is a small antique carving of
Christ in Glory (a <i>vesica piscis</i> enclosing the whole figure),
and angels of this form and attitude surrounding it with
curiously drawn symbols of the four evangelists. The
angels in the east wall of Bradford-on-Avon church are of
a similar character.</p>

<p>This seems to be an instance of Byzantine ornament
adopted by the Italian builders. The convoluted and
basket-work ornament may also have been derived from
the same source.</p>

<p>The stiff foliage and <i>intrecciatura</i> on Barnack church
tower are rude imitations of Comacine work.</p>

<p>Wherever the Comacines established themselves they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
founded lodges; to each lodge a <i>schola</i> and a <i>laborerium</i>
were attached, where the members received instruction
and training in the several branches of their craft. The
Comacines who settled with Augustine in the royal city
of Canterbury, must have established according to their
custom a lodge and a <i>schola</i> in that city, for there Wilfrid
some seventy years later sent for architects and builders
(<i>c&oelig;mentarii</i>) to renew the Cathedral Church of York
which had been built by Paulinus, but possibly through
increase of population was now inadequate. The plan
of the ancient church has been traced; it was Basilican in
form, with aisles and an apse.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Wilfrid, Bishop of York for forty-three years, was, while
still a young man, sent to Rome as a companion to Biscop,
a Saxon thane who was afterwards Abbot of Wearmouth
and Jarrow. There, says Bede, he spent some months in
the study of ecclesiastical matters. On his way home
he remained in Gaul for three years. When he returned
to Britain at the expiration of that time, King Alfred gave
him land and the monastery of Ripon where he built a
spacious church, which excited universal astonishment and
admiration; though not so large as the church he afterwards
built at Hexham, it was a noble building. The
apse with its altar was at the west end, and underneath
the apse was a <i>confessio</i>, which with its passages still exists.
The round-headed arches within the church were supported
by lofty columns of polished stone.</p>

<p>But beautiful as this church was, that at Hexham
exceeded it. Eddius Stephanus, precentor of York, the
biographer of Wilfrid, and Richard of Hexham, give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
enthusiastic descriptions of it which accord exactly with
what we know the Comacine church of the period to have
been.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>From them we learn that St. Andrews, Hexham, built by
Wilfrid, was a Basilican church, and in one respect at least
it was similar to Ripon; the apse was at the west end, and
beneath it was a crypt with passages around it; the crypt
with its passages is still to be seen. The proportions of the
church were however nobler and the details richer. The walls
were covered with square stones of divers colours and
polished; the columns were also of polished stone; the
capitals of the columns, arches, and vault of apse, and space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
over the apse-arch were decorated with sculptures and
histories (<i>i.e.</i> with paintings representing sacred scenes) all
very splendid and very beautiful, according to Eddius.</p>

<p>As regards the sculptures, the examples we have of
Saxon sculptures show them to have been generally vigorous,
and often grotesque. A writer in <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. viii.
p. 174, states that in the vaults of Hexham there were at
the time he wrote many Roman inscriptions and grotesque
carvings. The capitals of columns in Saxon as well as in
later times not infrequently bore grotesque ornament for
decoration, and it was commonly used for other purposes;
not even coffins were exempt from decorations of this nature.
Reginaldus de Coldingham (de virtutibus S. Cuthberti)
describes the double coffin of St. Cuthbert, the inner one
being of black oak elaborately carved, the subject of one of
the carvings being a monk turned into a fox for stealing
new cheese.</p>

<p>As regards their paintings, the Comacines were rather
given to colour&mdash;it was in one of their churches, that
of S. Maria del Tiglio, built by Theodolinda, wife of King
Autharis, that the Emperor Lothaire beheld a brilliantly
painted picture which adorned the vault of the apse and
represented "The three kings presenting gifts to the Child
Jesus." The picture moved the king to undertake the
restoration of the church.</p>

<p>The Comacines also used frescoes in Theodolinda's
palace at Monza in the fifth and sixth centuries.</p>

<p>From the foregoing description of Hexham church by
Eddius Stephanus, it would appear that there were galleries
over the aisles to which access was gained by spiral stairways
in the wall. Similar galleries and spiral stairway
still exist in the church of S. Agnese in Rome. In this
church between the nave and the aisles there is a double
arcade of open arches one above the other; the higher
arcade on each side forms the front of the galleries&mdash;above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
these is a clerestory. The church of S. Lorenzo at Verona,
also a Comacine church, contains a spiral stairway in the
wall which led to the different divisions in the women's
gallery for the widows, matrons, and girls. So far I have
not heard of any ancient spiral stairways as still existing in
any other than in these Comacine churches.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_220" id="i_220"></a>
<img src="images/i_220.jpg" width="349" height="477" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tower of S. Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna.</span></p>
</div>

<p>These galleries and arcades may be regarded as the
original of the triforium.</p>

<p>Eddius relates that there were also bell-towers at
Hexham of surprising height, and this suggests reflections.
Hexham was built about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 674, early in the Saxon period,
and these tall towers were built wholly at that time. What
were they like? The early Comacine towers were built in
several stages; the lowest generally had either no windows
or slits; the next stage above had single-light windows, plain
round-headed and straight-sided, as if cut out of the wall;
in the stages above the windows were of two or three
lights divided by colonnettes, the larger number of lights
being in the windows of the upper stages; in each stage
there were commonly four windows, one opening to each
quarter of the compass. Wolstan's description of the tower
of Winchester answers very nearly to this. He says it consisted
of five storeys; in each were four windows looking
towards the four cardinal points, which were illuminated
every night.</p>

<p>As examples of early Latin towers, the round towers
of S. Apollinare nuovo, and S. Apollinare in Classe,
Ravenna, and perhaps the square tower of S. Giovanni
Evangelista, may be given. Take any one of them,
that of S. Apollinare nuovo, for instance. Cut off the
upper stages by holding the hand above the eyes, and
regard only the lower stages with the single-light windows,
and you have a structure which might be Roman. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
looks very much older than the complete tower; and it is
the same with well-known Saxon towers in England, so that
some persons have been misled into thinking that the lowest
stages with straight-cut single-light windows are much older
than the upper portion with double or treble-light windows&mdash;which
does not at all follow, at least not from that fact,
for they might be of the same date;&mdash;and they have argued
that these lower stages both in Italy and England are older
than the upper ones, notwithstanding the improbability that
the old builders would place a heavy tower on walls originally
intended to carry only a light roof.</p>

<p>The Saxon towers have clearly a Latin or Comacine
origin. The walls are usually of stone grouted in the old
Roman manner; and when Lombard windows, of two or
more lights, with a column dividing them, are used, they
are, as a rule, in the upper and not in the lower stages.
Unfortunately we have no towers of the earliest Saxon
period still standing; but the resemblance between the
later Saxon and the early Italian towers is apparent. The
same may be said of the later Comacine towers, S. Satyrus,
Milan, for instance (<a href="#i_223"><i>see</i> plate</a>), which Cattaneo assigns to
the ninth century, and regards as the prototype of Lombard
towers; take away the little pensile arch ornament, which
was characteristic of the Comacine style known as Lombard,
and you have a tower which might be Saxon.</p>

<p>Whilst Wilfrid was engaged in building Hexham, his
friend and companion in travel, Biscop, was building the
monastery and monastic church of Wearmouth. Biscop
was a Saxon thane of Northumberland; he became a monk
of the monastery of S. Lerino, and, according to Henry of
Huntingdon, on his return from Rome, King Egfrid gave
him sixty hides of land, on which he built the monastery of
Wearmouth. Eight years later, the king granted him more
land at Jarrow, upon which he built a monastery and church.
The former was dedicated to St. Peter, the latter to St. Paul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_223" id="i_223"></a>
<img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="354" height="486" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tower of S. Satyrus, Milan.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On obtaining possession of the lands at Wearmouth,
Biscop, according to Bede,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> set out for Gaul, to find builders
to build the monastic church, "juxta Romanorum quem
semper amabat morem."</p>

<p>It might be asked, If there was at Canterbury a Comacine
school of architecture whose special function it was to
build on the Roman model, why did not Bishop Benedict
send there for architects and masons? The simple answer
is, that Wilfrid had already engaged them for his work at
Hexham. Wilfrid was building both a church and monastery
there, and evidently had employment for every hand he
could obtain.</p>

<p>The building of Hexham was commenced in 674, and
it was not till that date that Biscop was in a position to
engage workmen for Wearmouth, so that Wilfrid was just
beforehand with Biscop, who in consequence had to look
elsewhere for his architects, and he set out for Gaul to
engage them there.</p>

<p>Now it does not at all follow that because Biscop
brought his masons from Gaul, therefore they were not
Comacines. It was as easy to find Comacines in Gaul
as in England. We find them settled there at a later
date, when they were called <i>artefici Franchi</i>. There
is nothing to show definitely, but there is presumptive
evidence of a settlement of a guild in Gaul at this time,
and it was probably some of the French Comacines that
Biscop employed, for Biscop insisted on a church built after
the Roman manner, a Basilica; he would have nothing
else, and no builders could build a Basilica better than the
successors to the Roman college of architecture.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>It seems further probable that these Gallican architects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
were Comacines, from the fact that they followed the
practice of the Comacines in establishing a <i>schola</i> at Wearmouth,
possibly amongst the monks, for Naitan, King of
the Picts, sent to Cedfrid, who succeeded Benedict as
abbot, and begged him to send architects to him to build
a church in his nation "after the Roman manner," and the
abbot complied with his request.</p>

<p>Mr. Micklethwaite states that "the doorway under the
tower of the church at Monkswearmouth in Durham was
doubtless a part of the church which Benedict Biscop
erected there in the seventh century in imitation of the
Basilicas in Rome. The twined serpents with birds' beaks
on the right doorpost are, as we know from MSS. of that
age, singularly characteristic of the style."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> There is a
similar design on the architrave of an ancient door in San
Clemente, Rome.</p>

<p>The decoration of the church seems to have been in the
highest style of ecclesiastical art of the age. Even glass-makers,
who might have been Comacines, were brought
from France to make glass for glazing the windows of the
church and of the cells of the monks&mdash;no glass had ever
before in Saxon times been used in England for windows&mdash;and
even paintings were brought from abroad for the
decoration of the walls. Bede, in his sermon on the anniversary
of the death of Benedict, states that he imported
paintings of holy histories, which should serve not only for
the beautification of the church, but for the instruction of
those who looked upon them; vases, vestments, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
things necessary for the service of the church, were also
brought from Gaul, and those things which could not be
obtained there, were brought "from the country of the
Romans."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_228" id="i_228"></a>
<img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="496" height="363" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The church was pronounced by monkish writers to be
for two centuries the grandest and most beautiful church
on this side of the Alps; even Roman architects admitted
that they who saw Hexham church might imagine themselves
amidst Roman surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>There is one point in connection with Saxon architecture
not touched. In much of the Saxon building now standing
there are projecting ribs of stone in the masonry which are
commonly known under the name of pilaster strips. The
masonry in which it occurs is perhaps always late Saxon
work. The strips seem to be similar to the pilasters in the
front of Lombard churches; in the latter they are more
ornamental in detail, and are often in the form of shafts
occasionally decorated.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The external arcading, as in Bradford-on-Avon, seems
to be a modification of late Roman work, followed in various
forms in Comacine, Lombard, Saxon, and Norman work.
In its original form it may be seen on the exterior of
the Basilica of S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna, where
external arcadings in the masonry of the walls will be
noticed both in the walls of the aisles and in the walls
of the nave above the aisles, the arcading being carried
on pilasters built into, and forming part of, the walls; the
pilasters with the arcading serving to give rigidity to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
walls, enabling them to resist the outward thrust of the roof
as buttresses were intended to do in later times. This
church was built about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 300.</p>

<p>In Comacine or early Lombard churches there was an
arcading on steps in the gable of the west front, the steps
giving access to the roof on the outside. In later Lombard
churches this arcading became simply an ornamental detail
to the front. To this type belongs the arcading on
Bradford-on-Avon church. In Norman churches it degenerated
into a corbel table, in which the shafting was
omitted, the heads of the arches being supported on
corbels.</p>

<p>The Byzantine character of some of the ornaments in
Comacine and Saxon work is accounted for by the fact
that the Comacine order found refuge in a Romano-Greek
colony in which the Greek influence was strong, and in all
probability there were Byzantine guilds working alongside
of it. That there is a trace of Oriental form in it is not
surprising, when it is remembered how much communication
there was between all parts of the Christian world notwithstanding
the difficulties of travelling. Teliau, David, and
Paternus journeyed to Jerusalem. On arriving at the Temple
they were placed in three ancient stalls in the Temple, and
after expounding the Scriptures were elected by the people
and consecrated bishops (<i>Vita S. Teliaui Episcopi</i>). Columbanus,
an Irish saint, established a monastery amidst the
ruins of the ancient Roman city of Bobbio in Italy. St.
Cumean, born in 592, obtained possession of a deserted
church in the same city, restored it and served it.</p>

<p>According to the chronicles of Fontenelle, bishops and
clergy, abbots and monks came from all parts, even from
Greece and Armenia, to visit Richard Duke of Normandy,
brother-in-law of our Saxon King Ethelred and a great
church-builder; the Oriental character of some of the
ornaments in Oxford cathedral, which Ethelred rebuilt, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
attributed to the influence of Richard and his Oriental
visitors, for Ethelred took refuge in Normandy for a time
to avoid the Danes.</p>

<p>Some Saxons left England at the Norman Conquest
and settled in Constantinople, where they built a church
for themselves and other members of the Saxon colony
there.</p>

<p>St. Germanus when he left Britain went to Ravenna,
then the royal city.</p>

<p>Asser relates that Alfred received embassies daily from
foreign parts, from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the farthest
limits of Spain, and that he had seen letters and presents
which had been sent to the king by Abel, Patriarch of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Many British monks, some of whose lives and legends
may still be found in early MSS., travelled to the south and
east, and all over the known world, and being skilled in
architecture, might readily have made copies of ornaments
which took their fancy when travelling in Eastern countries,
and introduced them on their return.</p>

<p>Let us restate the argument briefly&mdash;</p>

<p>1. When Italy was overrun by the barbarians, Roman
<i>Collegia</i> were everywhere suppressed.</p>

<p>2. The architectural college of Rome is said to have
removed from that city to the republic of Comum.</p>

<p>3. In early mediæval times, one of the most important
Masonic guilds in Europe was the Society of Comacine
Masters, which in its constitution, methods, and work was
essentially Roman, and seems to have been the survival of
this Roman college.</p>

<p>4. Italian chroniclists assert that architects and masons
accompanied Augustine to England, and later Italian and
continental writers of repute adopt that view.</p>

<p>5. Whether this is proved or not, it was customary for
missionaries to take in their train persons experienced in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
building, and if Augustine did not do so, his practice was
an exception to what seems to have been a general rule.
Besides, a band of forty monks would have been useless
to him unless some of them could follow a secular calling
useful to the mission, for they were unacquainted with the
British language, and could not act independently.</p>

<p>6. Masonic monks were not uncommon, and there were
such monks associated with the Comacine body; so that
qualified architects were easily found in the ranks of the
religious orders.</p>

<p>7. From Bede's account of the settlement of Augustine's
mission in Britain, it seems clear that he must have brought
Masonic architects with him.</p>

<p>8. Gregory would be likely to choose architects for the
mission from the Comacine Order, which held the old Roman
traditions of building, rather than those of a Byzantine
guild, and the record of their work in Britain proves that
he did.</p>

<p>9. In Saxon as in the earlier Comacine carvings, there
are frequent representations of fabulous monsters, symbolical
birds and beasts, the subjects of some of these carvings
being suggested, apparently, by the "Physiologus," which
had a Latin origin.</p>

<p>10. In the writings of the Venerable Bede, and Richard,
Prior of Hagustald, we meet with phrases and words which
are in the Edict of King Rotharis of 643, and in the
<i>Memoratorio</i> of 713 of King Luitprand, which show that
these writers were familiar with certain terms of art used
by the Comacine Masters.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

THE TOWERS AND CROSSES OF IRELAND</h3>

<p>The saints or early missionaries seem to be as closely
connected with the first church-building in Ireland as they
were in Gaul, Normandy, and England; only by some
curious circumstance, Ireland became christianized and
built her churches some centuries earlier than England and
Normandy. It is my conviction that in casting off the
legends connected with saints, we have also cast off much
real history belonging to the early missions. Now, the
preceding chapter shows that it is precisely to these first
missionaries that we are indebted for the imported architecture
of the pre-Norman date in England, and presumably
also in Ireland. This architecture has been an enigma and
a stumbling-block to archæologists for ages; because while
rejecting everything connected with the saints as legend,
they also reject the only reasonable hypothesis of the
genesis of these first stone buildings, which sprang up in a
country as yet only accustomed to build in wood or earth.</p>

<p>The Round Towers of Ireland, for instance, have formed
a greater puzzle to antiquaries than the churches of
Hexham or Lindisfarne&mdash;partly because of their antiquity,
and partly from their unlikeness to any local buildings of
the time. The theories in regard to them are wild beyond
all probability. They have been attributed: (1) By Henry
O'Brien to the Tuatha De Danaan, a Persian colony which
is supposed to have built them for phallic worship. (2) By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Vellaney to the Ph&oelig;nicians, the buildings being afterwards
used by the Druids as fire-towers. (3) By Dr. Lynch,
Peter Walsh, Molyneux, etc., to the Danes, as war-towers.</p>

<p>Petrie, with clearer arguments, claims them as Christian.
In his Prize Essay on the origin and uses of the Round
Towers (<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1820) he proves that no buildings except
these towers were known to have cement in pre-Christian
Ireland. For the Pagans and Druids have left us the great
fortresses of Dun Ængus, and Dun Connor on Aran Mor,
and the great sepulchres of Dowth and New Grange, all
built without cement and of unhewn stones. Now the
Round Towers are of hewn stones closely fitted and
cemented, till they are solid as a rock, standing firm as ever,
after their fifteen centuries of existence. They are called in
Ireland by the generic name of "cloic-theack," or bell-house,
and are invariably found close to the ruins of a monastery
or a church. In some cases, like the one at Clonmacnoise,
the church has entirely disappeared, leaving only the graveyard
to mark its site, and in the graveyard a veritable
Comacine cross!</p>

<p>It cannot be proved that the towers belong to an earlier
age than the churches attached, for we have a witness in
the ruins themselves. The masonry of the tower and the
remaining walls of the church at Kilmacduagh is identical,
as are the later tower and church-porch at Roscrea&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
good, solid <i>opus gallicum</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Stokes and the Rev. John Healy uphold the theory<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
of their being towers of refuge in warlike times. They may
well have been used as such, on account of their strength,
and also their proximity to the churches, which were always,
in the Middle Ages, inviolable cities of refuge. This, however,
does not affect our question as to how the towers came
into Ireland, and whence came their builders. In the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
place, where can similar towers be found dating from times
contemporary? The answer is decided: in Italy. In
Ravenna and Lombardy, from the date <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 300 to the fifth
and sixth centuries; and they show just that Eastern touch
which distinguishes the Byzantine-Roman architecture at
Ravenna, and has caused authors to seek the origin of the
Round Towers further east than Italy.</p>

<p>The next question that arises is: What was the point of
contact between Ireland and Italy? As in England and
Normandy we shall, I believe, find it in the first missions.
The first Irish missionary was doubtless St. Patrick, <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
373-464, who has been taken as the sign and symbol of
Celticism. Yet he was not an Irishman by birth. His father
was a Christian named Calphurnius, his mother was niece
to St. Martin of Tours; he was consequently of continental
origin. His birthplace was Nempthur near Dumbarton, and
while yet a boy he was carried a prisoner to Ireland, and
the heathendom there appealed so strongly to his feelings,
that after his release he was haunted by visions foretelling
his future mission to convert Ireland. Pope Celestin I.
gave him his mission in about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 430, and he settled in
Armagh, where he laboured more than thirty years converting
and baptizing both kings and people. He founded
schools and built churches. Probably the first worship was
conducted in the open air, where a cross was set up, as by
the English missionaries. The cross was of the Byzantine
form used at that time in Italy; but on its adoption by the
northern saint-missionaries it became known in Britain as
the Irish cross. The ancient Italian one, once in the
Forum at Rome, is of identical style, though of earlier
date. St. Patrick's influence remained and spread. Many
of his followers in the ministry made the pilgrimage to
Rome which he had made, and so great was the fame of
sanctity of these Irish preaching brethren, that they were
reverenced in Italy even more than in their native land.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>S. Fredianus became Bishop of Lucca, and Columban
was Abbot of Bobbio. It is to these later missionaries rather
than to St. Patrick himself that we must look, as having
introduced Italian or Comacine architecture into Ireland.
That they were addicted to church-building is evident from
their at once setting to work wherever they went; S.
Fredianus building a church and monastery at Lucca; St.
Columban doing the same at Bobbio.</p>

<p>And what architects did they employ? Surely some
members of the Comacine Guild, or their monk colleagues.
They had seen them at the court of the Longobardic
kings where they tarried and were entertained during their
journey to Rome. And seeing the beautiful churches and
towers in Italy, all made by the magic hands of this guild,
is it not most likely that the Pope, who patronized the
guild as one of the most practical instruments in christianization,
should have counselled them to take back some
<i>Magistri</i> with them to Ireland? There is, I presume,
no documentary proof of this, but there are more imperishable
witnesses in the works themselves. The only
difference between the Round Towers of Ireland and
those of Italy in the first five centuries after Christ is the
conical roof, which is due entirely to exigencies of climate.
The hewing of the square stones, the close-fitting masonry,
the Roman cement, the simple arches of the windows with
their solidly cut supports, are all pure Lombard-Roman of
the time when S. Fredianus and Columban were in Italy.
It is true that with this similarity there is also a certain
clumsiness of workmanship in the Irish towers, which
suggests that either the Italian architects imported by the
Irish missionaries were the less skilful men of the guild,
or, what is more probable, they were few, and had to train
native and unskilled workmen to assist them; but the style
they aimed at, and the forms they used, are the early Italian
ones of from <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 300 to 500.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>In Cormac's chapel at the Rock of Cashel we get the
square tower such as later Comacines used from the sixth to
the tenth centuries, with the double-arched window of the
period; and the church beside it has the same signs. Here
are the string courses supported by the row of little arches,
the projecting apse, and the double-light windows, with
only that same northern desideratum&mdash;the high gable and
sloping roof. Cormac was an early Bishop of Cashel, who
was killed in 907 <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Look at the shrine of the Bell of St. Patrick, which I
presume dates from about the eighth century, <i>i.e.</i> the
time of Fredianus, and you will see a fine collection of
Comacine <i>intrecci</i> or interlaced work in sculpture. As
for the crosses of Ireland, one may trace in them the
development of Comacine work, from the early Christian
Roman style to the mediæval Lombard.</p>

<p>The beautifully illustrated article in the <i>Studio</i> for Aug.
15, 1898, by J. Romilly Allen, F.S.A., shows the whole line.
In the earliest form of Irish cross, <i>i.e.</i> that where the cross
and Christian symbols are merely cut into the face of a slab
of stone, such as in the cross at Reask, Co. Kerry, we see
precisely the primitive style of art shown in the Catacombs.
The "Gurmarc" stones have their prototype in the earliest
Longobardic carving, such as the <i>pluteus</i> of Theodolinda's
first church at Monza. The smaller of the three inscribed
circles has an even more advanced Comacine <i>intreccio</i> enclosed
within the circle, while the cross of Honelt at Llantwit
Major (Fig. 5) has a splendid Comacine knot such as
one sees on every Longobardic church, placed beneath a
very Byzantine geometrical design in which circles, crosses,
triangles, and three-fold knots are marvellously intermingled.
These are all stones merely incised, and foreshadow the
predilection of the Irish converts for the symbolism of the
time, the cross of Christ within the unending circle of
eternity. The next development shown by Mr. Romilly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Allen is the upright cross slab at St. Madoes in Perthshire,
where the cross and the circle are in distinct relief and not
merely incised. Here, instead of the circle enclosing the
Greek cross, it has become subordinate, and is placed behind
the arms of a Latin cross. In fact a complete Irish cross in
relief. But how is it adorned?&mdash;with splendid Comacine
<i>intrecci</i>, and all the symbolism so familiar to us in early
Italian art. Here are the coiled serpent and the dove
above, with the four mystic beasts of the Apocalypse below,
two on each side of the stem of the cross; and the workmanship
and designs are literally identical with those of the
sculptures on the façades of the first church of S. Michele
at Pavia, and S. Zeno at Verona, and that of S. Pietro at
Spoleto, all of the fifth and sixth centuries. (Spoleto church
was rebuilt in 1329, but the ancient Lombard sculptures
around the doorway were preserved.)</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_166">See page 166.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>By the ninth and tenth centuries the Irish cross had
reached its full development. It was no longer a sign on
a slab, but a beautiful upright sculptured cross, with a circle
crowning it like a halo, and suggesting the eternity of the
human cross of our Saviour. And here again the art is
precisely that of the Italian sculptors. There was a cross
of earlier date than either the cross of King Flami at
Clonmacnoise, King's County, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 904, or the cross of
Mucreadach at Monasterboice, Co. Louth, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 924, in the
Roman Forum, of which the shape and ornaments are similar
to both of them. The cross of SS. Patrick and Columban at
Kells has, too, all the marks of the Comacine work in the
eighth and ninth centuries, as one sees it in the oldest churches
at Como and Verona, at Toscanella and Spoleto. All these
things being considered, I think Irish archæologists would
do well to work up the undoubted connection of the early
Irish missionaries with Italy, and the influence their travels
there had, not only on the religion, but the art of Ireland.
They might discover whether St. Columban, when King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Agilulf sheltered him at Pavia, took from the artists then
at work at the wondrous front of S. Michele, any ideas
which he caused to be reproduced in the crosses placed
by him to sanctify the open-air worship of his Irish converts;
or whether he took a few monkish <i>Magistri</i> skilled
in sculpture from his monastery at Bobbio to carve those
very crosses, and to build the first stone churches, that now
lie in ruins at the feet of the rugged old towers.

<p>The rise of the Romanesque is the stepping-stone to the
Renaissance of Art in Italy. We need not enter at length
into all the vexed questions of how this Renaissance
began, and which school was the link between that and
classic art, but a slight glance must be given to the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Some make everything begin from Niccolò Pisano, as
though he suddenly sprang ancestorless out of the darkness,
a full-fledged artist. Some date the rise of art from
the Byzantines in Aquileja and Venice; others again
from the union of the Normans with the Saracens in
Sicily.</p>

<p>First, as to Pisa. There are no records or signs of a
school of art indigenous to Pisa, before the building of the
Duomo there. Both Morrona<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and Ridolfi, the historians
of the respective cities, have well searched the archives in
both Pisa and Lucca, but can find no single reference to
any native artist before the Duomo of Pisa was begun, or
even of any Pisan who worked at that building as early as
the eleventh century. All the first architects seem to have
been imported. Morrona asserts that when the cathedral
was begun "the most famous <i>Masters</i> (mark the word)
from foreign (<i>stranieri</i>) parts, assembled together to give
their work to the building." The word <i>stranieri</i> is used
by all old Italians not only as meaning foreigners, but
Italians from other provinces. Ridolfi, on his part, affirms
that at the beginning, the <i>Maestri di Como</i> were the only
ones employed in building the chief churches at Lucca;
adding that&mdash;"Many of the works show certain symbols,
monsters and foliage, which were always a special characteristic
of the Comacines, and a sign of the Freemasonry
founded and propagated by them."<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>From this it may be deduced that during the eleventh
and twelfth centuries no indigenous Pisan school existed,
and that the mediæval buildings were of the Lombard type.
Certainly the old church of S. Pietro a Grado, three miles
out of Pisa on the Leghorn road, which we have described,
is a standing witness to the presence of the Comacines
before this era. It still exists, the most perfect specimen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
extant of a Lombard tri-apsidal church. Not a shaft,
not an archlet is wanting.</p>

<p>As to Aquileja and Venice, Selvatico's<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> theory is that
the Friuli people, and those of Aquileja, being driven out
in 450 by Attila, fled to Grado (another Grado near Venice),
thence spread to Torcello and Murano, and then founded
Venice. That they built the cathedrals on those islands,
and founded the Veneto-Oriental school. Did this native
school ever exist? asks Merzario, seeing that the church
of Grado was built by <i>artefici Franchi</i>, which might
mean Freemasons, or French builders, <i>i.e.</i> the Comacines
under Charlemagne; and that those of Santa Fosca and
Murano were, judging by their style, of the same origin?</p>

<p>The church of Torcello was rebuilt in the eleventh
century by the Bishop Orso Orseolo, and if it comes into
the question at all, would prove that the Lombard school
had something to do with it then. In spite of these two
opposing opinions, it is certain that architecture took a
certain distinctive form in Venice; but it was a later
development which occurred after the twelfth century, and
with which the Greeks and Byzantines had little or nothing
to do.</p>

<p>Selvatico, although the champion of the Veneto-Friuli
theory, is constrained almost in spite of his own arguments
to own that the Lombard architects had their part in early
Venetian architecture, saying&mdash;"Although the prevalent
architecture of Venice from the seventh to the thirteenth
centuries consists of Byzantine and Roman elements, yet
after <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000 another element mingled with it, which
though partly the product of the two, nevertheless had in
itself elements so original as to be truly national. This is
the art which modern writers style Lombard, which, born
first in Lombardy, diffused itself over the greater part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Italy, and then crossing the Alps expanded greatly in
Northern Europe."<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The learned Domenico Salazari is at the head of the
Siculo-Norman theory, but the influence of the mingling of
Oriental and Saracenic architecture with the Norman and
Lombard elements in Sicily are so well known, and so
fully acknowledged, that it is useless to go over his prolix
arguments.</p>

<p>It seems to me that each party is right as far as it
goes. Venetian architecture has Oriental elements in it;
the Tuscan Renaissance truly dates from Niccolò Pisano,
and the Romanesque style was formed by the marriage of
north and south in Sicily; but none of their advocates have
got hold of the missing link in the development of each
special school from the old classical styles. And that
missing link, if anywhere, is to be looked for in the
Comacines.</p>

<p>In the ninth century they went northward, and laid
the seeds of the round-arched Norman architecture at
Dijon, under S. Guglielmo; a seed which took root and
developed. In the next century they appear to have
planted the seed of French Gothic at Aix-la-Chapelle, and
of German Gothic at Cologne and Spires, and these grew
to be goodly trees. In the eleventh century they again
met their brethren of the north in Sicily; and all worked
together, adding to their own beauties those of the rich
and varied Saracenic style&mdash;and the Romanesque style was
thus formed.</p>

<p>The Venetian link dates about the same era. Fortunato,
the Patriarch of Aquileja, called in the Comacines
about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 828, and their churches there show a groundwork
of form and masonry quite Romano-Lombard, with an
ornamentation of which it is difficult to say whether it be
more Byzantine than Comacine, the two being so similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
in conception, and the distinctive difference in technical
work being at this distance of time not always distinguishable.
Where the Byzantines worked in sandstone, the
sharp edges of their precise cutting would have worn off
during many centuries; and where the Comacines worked
in marble, their marvellous knots and interlacings may look
as clean-cut now as any time-worn Byzantine sculptures.
In any case the union of Lombard and Byzantine in Venice
was the forging of the link connecting Venetian art to the
classic Roman.</p>

<p>The part the Comacines had in forging the connecting
chain between the Tuscan Renaissance and the classic
Roman, and the artistic pedigree of Niccolò Pisano, who is
the first link in that branch of the threefold chain, will be
traced in a future chapter. We must now inquire how the
first Romano-Lombard style of the Comacines, from the
sixth to the tenth centuries, became changed into the florid
Romanesque, in which the same guild was building in all
parts of Italy from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries.
This development was possibly derived from both Northern
and Southern sources.</p>

<p>The close connection of the Comacine or Lombard
architects with the Patriarch of Aquileja in the seventh and
eighth centuries brought them in touch with the Greek
artists of the earlier period, from whom they learned much,
especially in varying the plan of their circular churches, and
in richness of ornamentation. Their later emigrations to the
southern Lombard dukedoms, and their work in Sicily had
a still greater effect on them. It seemed to break up their
fixed traditions as a thaw breaks up ice. Before this time,
every church must be of a fixed plan; every apse round;
every space of wall headed by a gallery or arched brackets;
every arch a pure half-circle on colonnettes. But the varied
arches of the Oriental-Saracenic style influenced their fancy;
they saw that art lay in variety, and learned that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
pointed arch was as strong as the round one, the ogival
arch more graceful. The Moorish arch never entirely took
their fancy, though they sometimes gave a slight Moorish
curve to their stilted arches.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the <i>Magistri</i> of the Comacine
Guild were no longer of the same calibre as those
mediæval men who built for the Longobards. Those
were the products of an age of slavery and degeneration,
who, lacking literature, clung to tradition, and could only
act according to the small portion of intellectual light
vouchsafed to the Dark Ages. They put stone and stone
together, precisely as their forefathers had taught them.
In form they clung to their ancient teacher, Vitruvius, and
for their ornamentation to their ancient pagan superstitions,
grafted on a mystical Christianity. Yet, as we have seen,
they so far improved on these, as to build several Basilican
churches which might be called grand for the time, though
still holding close to traditional forms.</p>

<p>The Comacine after <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000 was a man beginning
to feel his intellect; the feudal system was breaking up,
republics beginning to be established, schools were opened,
and man began to feel himself no longer a vassal bound
hand and foot, but a human being who might use his own
intellect for his own pleasure and good.</p>

<p>What wonder then, that the arts began to flourish,
commerce to increase, and riches to accrue in this joyous
freedom?</p>

<p>And what wonder that man's thankfulness for freedom
first took the form of building churches for the glory of the
God of the free?</p>

<p>The architects of the Masonic <i>loggie</i> (lodges) who had
held together through the troublous times, became alive
with new enthusiasms. They compared their own buildings
with others, and instead of varying the principles of
Vitruvius, to suit early Christian demands as heretofore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
they passed on to new and freer lines. Instead of solid
and rude strength, elegance of form and aspiring lines gave
lightness and beauty.</p>

<p>The starting-point of the change was, of course, the
adoption of the pointed arch, which at this time began to
be substituted for the circular one as giving greater
strength with greater lightness. "<i>Curvetur arcus ut
fortior</i>," says an old chronicler of Subiaco. According
to their method of gradual development the Comacine
Masters did not blindly throw themselves into new forms.
They went cautiously, and first tried their acute arches in
clerestories, and triforia, over naves supported by the
old Lombard arches of <i>sesto intiero</i>, as we see in several
churches of the Transition period. A little later they mixed
the two inextricably, as in Florence cathedral, where the
windows are pointed with Gothic tracery, the interior
arches round and Roman in form.</p>

<p>"The early Lombard architecture," said Cesare Cantù,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
"was not an order, nor a system, so much as a delirium.
Balance and symmetry utterly disregarded, no harmony
of composition or taste, shameful neglect in form proportion;
to the perfect classic design which satisfies the
eye, they substituted incoherent and useless parts, with
frequently the weak placed to support the strong, in
defiance of all laws of statics. Columns&mdash;which used to
be composed of a base, shaft, and capital, in just proportions,
supporting a well-adapted architrave or frieze
more or less fitly adorned, and a cornice which only added
beauty and strength&mdash;were exchanged for certain colonnettes,
either too short or too slight, knotted, spiral, and
grouped so as to torture the eye, and above the disproportioned
and inharmonious abacus of the capitals were
placed the arches, which in a good style should rest on the
architrave. In fine, there was an endless <i>modanature</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
ribs, reliefs, and windows of elongated form and walls of
extraordinary height." In spite of Cantù's leanings to the
classic, this tirade shows the first indication of the change
towards the Gothic, and it only proves that the Comacine
Masters did not take up new forms borrowed entire from
other nations, but assimilated what they saw in other
places, gradually developing their style.</p>

<p>To find the origin of the pointed arch would be difficult.
Was it evolved from the arching trees in the German
forest? or was it from the rich Arabian mosque or ancient
Indian temple? or did the Comacines find it, just as they
acquired their Basilican forms, on Italian soil?</p>

<p>Germany, it is pretty well proved, got the seed of her
glorious Gothic from France or Italy, and nourished it
right royally. But the pointed arch is much more ancient
than German Gothic. It is to be seen in the tomb of
Atreus at Mycenæ, in an Etruscan tomb at Tarquinii, and
even in the subterranean gallery at Antequere in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
The pointed arches in the Mosque El Haram on Monte
Morea date from Caliph Omar's time, between 637 and
640. The Mosque of Amrou, with its curious combination
of pointed and horse-shoe arches, dates from 640.</p>

<p>The church of St. Francis at Assisi (1226) has generally
been accepted as the first instance in Italy, and it was soon
followed in the design for the church of S. Antonio at
Padua five years later; but there are two little churches
annexed to the monastery of Subiaco on Monte Telaso,
which were built, so say the chroniclers, one in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 981,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the other in 1053, in which some arches are round and
others acute.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Hope<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> quotes examples of this mixture of
round and acute arches in the ninth and tenth centuries at
Cluny, 1093-1134; the Abbey of Malmesbury in England,
which is in Lombard style; St. Mark's at Venice, 976-1071;
Subiaco, 847, and others.</p>

<p>"But," as Selvatico remarks,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> "these are isolated
instances determined by static reasons, and do not point
to a system." The Arab used the pointed arch as a
decorative principle, as well as for stability. As the style
spread in Europe it got modified, some countries keeping
to the ancient type, and others changing its proportions.
So the Arab arch became in the eleventh century the germ
of the ogival arch, and in the twelfth expanded in the
North into the most glorious forms of ecclesiastical Gothic
architecture.</p>

<p>The Comacines made their first steps towards a more
florid style, about the end of the eleventh century. The
change, as in all such growths of circumstance, was a
gradual one. First, a little more ornamentation, then a
slight change in the forms of arches; next, a less fixed
ground-plan of the churches, a mingling of the Greek
cross with the square-walled Basilica. After these slight
trials of their wings, came flights of imagination, and
endless variety of form and ornamentation; that variety
which could only spring from the ideas of many minds,
united in one work.</p>

<p>To see the earliest signs of a wider scheme of design
we must go to the region of Parma. Here in a little town
called Borgo S. Donnino&mdash;the ancient "Fidentia Julia"&mdash;about
fifteen miles north of Parma, is one of the finest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
early Romanesque churches in Italy. It was a great place
for pilgrimages in the Middle Ages, as it contained the tomb
of S. Domninus, who was martyred in the persecutions of
Maximian. Great miracles were worked at his shrine, and
religious fervour rose to such a height in the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, that the devotees collected money enough
to build a church, which they desired should be the finest
and most majestic of those times.</p>

<p>The work was finished before 1195. An ancient
document shows that the <i>Rettori</i> (civil governors) of
Milan, Verona, Mantua, Modena, Brescia, Faenza, Bologna,
Reggio, Gravedone, Piacenza, and Padua, with their suites,
all met there in that year to form a league against
Henry VI., son of Frederic Barbarossa, who seemed likely
to carry on the hostility of his father.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> We have no
documents to show who was the architect of the fine
Basilica of S. Donnino, but as the Comacines had their
<i>laborerium</i> at Parma, and as the work is clearly and
distinctly Romanesque, we may believe the old authors
who say that it arose <i>per lo scarpello dei Comacini</i>.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> If
internal evidence is wanting, the three lion portals of the
ornate façade bear witness to the hand of the Comacines of
the Romanesque epoch.</p>

<p>Another of their buildings which shows a marked
advance, was the cathedral of Trent&mdash;the gate of Italy
leading into Germany. This had been built in the first
Lombard style between 1124 and 1149, when it was
consecrated by the Patriarch of Aquileja. In 1207 the
Bishop Federigo Manga, Chancellor of the Emperor
Otho IV., formed a design to enlarge and almost rebuild
it. He commissioned a <i>Magistro Comacino</i> to superintend
the works, as appears from an inscription in Gothic letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
on the tomb of that very <i>Magister</i>. Anglicized it would
run&mdash;"In the year of our Lord 1212, the last day of
February, Master Adam of Arogno, of the diocese and
district of Como (<i>Magister Adam de Arognio cumanæ
diocesis et circuito</i>), began the work of this church and
constructed it. He with his sons and his <i>abbiatici</i> (underlings)
built the interior and exterior of this church with its
adjoining parts. He and his sons lie below in this
sepulchre. Pray for them."</p>

<p>Prof. Cipolla, in an article in <i>Arte e Storia di Firenze</i>,
quotes a poem written in 1309, in honour of the Duomo of
Trent and of the Comacine Master who had achieved so
much with his potent and clever hands (<i>Cumani Magistri
qui potenti manu non inani complevit</i>).</p>

<p>The church has since then undergone several restorations,
but in none of them has its plan been materially
altered. There is still the octagonal dome, the circular
apse at one end of the building, and the narthex at the
other. The façade still honestly follows the lines of the
roof, and has its little rows of pillared galleries across.
The outside of the apse shows the new tendency to
Romanesque more than the façade does; here arches and
friezes in horizontal circles around it, take the place of the
perpendicular shafts, and the single row of archlets on the
top. It is more in the style of the thirteenth and fourteenth-century
Lucca churches. The arch of the north
door rests on lions, which we may take as the secret sign
of Romanesque Comacine work between the tenth and
twelfth centuries, as the <i>intreccio</i> or Solomon's knot had
been their mark in the Lombard period.</p>

<p>The church of S. Maria Maggiore at Bergamo is a
valuable specimen not only of this transition in its early
stage, but of the culmination of the Romanesque, two
centuries later. An inscription on the arch of the portico
records that it was founded in the time of Pope Innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
II. and King Lothair II., <i>i.e.</i> about 1135, Rogerius being
then the Bishop of Bergamo.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The builder's name is also
recorded as Magister Fredus, probably short for Godfredus.
Magister Fredus is not expressly said here to be of the
Guild of Comacines, but as his work was entirely in
Lombard style, with a few slight indications of a freer
school, and as the architects who succeeded him were, as
may be proved by documents, Comacine Masters chiefly
from Campione, we may fairly make the hypothesis that
he too was one of the guild. The little that remains of
his work is to be seen in the interior, where the round arch
still predominates, and in the exterior walls of the apse,
with its crown of arches and colonnettes.</p>

<p>The parts due to the later brethren of the guild are
the rich ornamentation of the two façades with their
grand and characteristic Comacine porches, and also the
Baptistery. It was in 1340 that Giovanni, son of Ugone
(Big Hugh) of Campione, a <i>celebre scultore ed architetto</i>,
was commissioned to build this Baptistery. According to
the fixed laws of the Comacines he made it octagonal&mdash;the
mystic sign of the Trinity, being formed of a threefold
triangle. Around it entwine circles of arches and colonnettes,
some lines having double columns; these reach to
the cornice of the roof, which cornice is composed of reliefs
allusive to the Sacrament of Baptism.</p>

<p>This work finished, Magister Giovanni went to Bellano
on the east bank of Lake Como, together with two of his
brotherhood, the Magister Antonio, son of the late Jacopo
of Castellazzo da Peglio in the valley of Intelvi, and
Magister Comolo, son of the late Magister Gufredo&mdash;probably
a descendant of the Magister Fredus mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
above&mdash;of Asteno, near Porlezza, to rebuild the church
there, which had been ruined by age and repeated floods.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
This church is in pure Lombard style, and has a façade in
black and white marble, with a fine rose window, encircled
with terra-cotta foliaged decorations. After this Magister
Giovanni of Campione was recalled to Bergamo to adorn
the façades of the church which Fredus had left in a rough
state 200 years before. These two façades faced north
and south. Strange to say, the part opposite the altar has
no door. In this new emprise Giovanni brought as his
assistants his son Nicolino, a relative named Antonio
(probably the one who had worked with him at Bellano),
and a certain Giovanni Cattaneo, also from Campione.
Giovanni, who was head architect, decided not to renovate
the whole south façade facing the Piazza on which he
began first, but to concentrate his ornamentation on a fine
vestibule and doorway, to form a species of frontal. The
vestibule was finished in 1351, having taken only two
years. On the architrave he has himself chronicled it&mdash;"1351,
m. Johannes de Campillione C. B. (civis Bergomensis)
fecit hoc opus." The whole front seems to have
taken three years more, as on the base of the horse on
which St. Alexander, patron saint of Bergamo, sits, may be
read&mdash;"Filius Ughi de Campillione fecit hoc opus 1355."</p>

<p>Good Master John of Campione did not long survive
the execution of this masterpiece, for on the north porch
is inscribed&mdash;"1360. Magister Johannes f. q. (filius quondam)
Dom. Johannes de Campilio ... (abrasion) fecit hoc opus
in Christi nomine. Amen."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>This north porch, though so nearly coeval, shows a
much greater advance in style. It is an eloquent proof of
how architecture was progressing at this time by the grafting
on of different influences. John the father, being older,
kept more closely to his Lombard traditions. John the
son, being youthful and more open to conviction, took up
new ideas. He has kept the Lombard arch in his porch,
the moulding of which is extremely rich, and the lions of
Judah duly support his pillars, but he has filled in his arch
with very Gothic tracery, in trefoil arches, and over the
Lombard columns of the upper storey of the porch are
arches and decorations decidedly Oriental in appearance.
It is about as good a specimen of the rich chaos of ideas
that marks a transition stage as one can get, and shows
that John the younger had been influenced by the Saracen-Norman
influence in Sicily.</p>

<p>Fergusson, in his <i>Handbook of Architecture</i>, p. 790,
gives an illustration of this porch. The Campione family
evidently came from a race of sculptor-architects, for the
church of S. Maria at Bergamo contains a sculptural
work of much merit for the time, by Ugo da Campione,
the father of Giovanni senior. It is the tomb of Cardinal
Longhi degli Alessandri, who died at Avignon in 1329.
The almost mediæval artist compares not unfavourably
with a very modern master from Como, Vincenzo Velada
Ligurnetto, who in 1855 sculptured the neighbouring tomb
of Donizetti placed near it.</p>

<p>Coming down the valley of the Pò to Cremona, we
find ourselves on a scene of great Comacine industry.
There is the Baptistery, dating before <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000, and the
Cathedral begun in 1100. These were both works of the
Lombard Masters; their style is identical, and over the
architrave of the great cathedral door may be read in the
Gothic characters used by them&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><span class="s08">MCCLXXIIII.</span></p>
<p>Magister Jacobus Porrata.</p>
<p>da Cumis, fecit hanc Rotam.</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Rotam</i> refers to the wheel window, which is a remarkably
fine one, and is not, as some writers think, an illiterate
mis-spelling of <i>portam</i> (door). The rose window is prior
to the one which Jacopo or Lapo, the so-called father of
Arnolfo, placed in the façade of the Duomo of Arezzo, and
is even superior to it in richness of design. To Jacobus
Porrata is also attributed the principal entrance of Cremona
cathedral, with the statues of the four prophets beside it.
Over the architrave rises a species of porch, formed of little
Lombard galleries, fringing as it were the arch. Below
are the usual lion-supported pillars, the lions being carved
in fine red marble. The vestibule above is formed of
pointed arches, on each of which a lion crouches to sustain
the finishing <i>loggia</i>. The Comacine Masters seem to have
formed a school and <i>laborerium</i> at Cremona, for among the
archives of the Duomo a deed has been found entitled
<i>laborerio</i>, of the year 1289. It was drawn up by the
notary Degoldo Malatesta on December 12 of that year,
and on the part of the Rev<sup>do.</sup> P. Cozzaconte, Bishop of
Cremona, and the monk Ubertini, director and treasurer
to the works of the Duomo, making a contract with Bonino
and Guglielmo da Campione to build a stone stairway on
the north of the cathedral towards S. Nicolò, etc. etc.
The stairs still exist, with remains of some little turrets
which formed part of the design.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_187">See page 187.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>At Parma we have also precise data, and a name
carven in stone. The cathedral was begun in 1059, four
years before that of Pisa. It was finished by 1106, when
Pope Pasquale II. consecrated it, the great Countess
Matilda being present. In 1117 a part of it fell in an
earthquake, and the Bishop Bernardo apportioned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
receipts of several taxes to the rebuilding. Frederic
Barbarossa in 1162 confirmed this disposition of the taxes
and the work was continued. The <i>laborerium</i> of the
Comacines at Parma was at different times under two of
their chief sculptor-architects, Benedetto da Antelamo being
master of the lodge in 1178, and Giovanni Bono of Bissone
in 1281. Benedetto sculptured the now ancient pulpit
of the cathedral, which was supported on four columns,
and to which the relief of the Crucifixion, signed by him,
belonged. It is now in the third chapel on the right. He
also designed and erected the Baptistery, which, more than
any building of the time, shows an originality of idea quite
remarkable. It is built entirely of white marble, is of
course octagonal, that is <i>de règle</i>, and is surrounded by
rows of little pillared galleries, but in these he has made
his colonnettes classical, and has left out the arches entirely,
except in the upper one, substituting a solid flat marble
entablature for them. The lower part only has a circular
arch in each of the eight sides. The arches of the doorways
are very deep, and richly sculptured. One has four
dark marble pillars on each side of the door, of which the
lintels and architrave are richly carved in reliefs. The
north door has a Nativity of Christ in the lunette, and
a story of John the Baptist beneath it. The west portal
shows a realistic Last Judgment above, and on the sides
the seven ages of man, and Christ performing the seven
works of mercy. On the south door is the allegory of
Death from the mediæval religious romance of <i>Barlaam
and Josaphat</i>. The arches between the doors are filled in
with niches containing statues supported on black marble
Corinthian columns.</p>

<p>All round the building above the base is a frieze of the
real old animal myths and symbols, such as the Comacines
of two or three centuries earlier delighted in. The march
of the times had now substituted actual representations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
scriptural subjects, instead of mere symbols of dark mysteries,
but the <i>Magister</i> could not all at once leave behind him the
old emblems which had served his guild for centuries in the
way of ornamentation. The building is unique, and shows
daring independent thought at a time when independence
was most difficult.</p>

<p>Fergusson, however, blames the false principles of design.
He says the four upper storeys are only built to conceal a
dome, which is covered by a flat wooden roof. The roof
seen from above seems to be a flat tiled roof, and it has
a pretty solid bell-turret in the centre. The little arches
forming the upper range are slightly pointed. This Baptistery,
as well as the pulpit in the Duomo, bears the signature
of the builder and sculptor, and the date 1196.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>Val d'Antelamo, the native place of Benedictus, is a
valley near Lago Maggiore towards Laveno. It seems
probable that a branch school or lodge of the Comacines
existed here, of which Benedetto was at this epoch at the
head,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and gave the name to his pupils. They must have
emigrated like other branches of the guild, for in the
ancient statutes of Genoa we find several mentions of experts
in architecture, called <i>Magistri da Antelamo</i>, who were
called in by the city magistrates, when any building work
had to be valued or judged.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>As early as 1181 in the archives of S. Giorgio, one finds
the names Martino and Ottoboni, Magistri Antelami, and as
late as Nov. 27, 1855, a sentence was given at the Collegio
dei Giudici at Genoa by a Maestro Anteramo. The substitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of r for l is to this day a very common error among
Italians.</p>

<p>In 1161 a squadron of Masters from Lombardy was
called to renovate the cathedral of Faenza, which was much
ruined. These Masters accepted, and showed themselves
most proficient. So says an old writer quoted by Merzario,
but whether these very clever architects were the same
Antelami branch who worked at Parma cannot be decided.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
A later Comacine Master at Parma, whose name has come
down to us, is Giovanni Bono of Bissone, a little village
between Como and Lugano. The grand vestibule of the
principal door of Parma cathedral, with its lion-supported
columns, its bands of colonnettes and its rich sculpture, was
designed by him. In a Gothic inscription over the door
deciphered by Sig. Pezzana, we learn that the lions were
made by Giovanni Bono da Bissone in 1280, at the time
when Guido, Niccolao, Bernardino, and Benvenuti worked
in the <i>laborerium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>This inscription, for which I am indebted to Canonico
Pietro Tonarelli, is especially valuable, not only in fixing the
epoch of Giovanni Buono da Bissoni's work, but as proof of
the organization of the lodge and the brotherhood of its
members. The word <i>fratrum</i> certainly implies that the
<i>laborerium</i> was in the hands of a guild. The Canonico
Tonarelli writes in a letter from Parma, that in an estimate
in the archives of the Chapter, dated 1354, the <i>Fabbriceria</i>
was denominated <i>Domus laborerii seu fabricæ ... majoris
Ecclesiæ</i>, and that the administrators were called <i>fratres de
Laborerio</i>. In Tuscany they were called <i>Operai</i>, and the
office of administrator was the <i>Opera del Duomo</i>. The
four names of the <i>fratres</i>, too, have a significance when read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
in the light I have since found thrown on the organization by
the archives of the <i>Opere</i> in Siena and Florence. In those
lodges one perceives plainly that the administration of the
lodge was placed under four persons, of whom two were
Masters of the guild, and two were influential persons of the
city, <i>i.e.</i> half the council of administration gave the votes
of the architects employed, and the other half those of the
patrons who employed them. That the same rule held
in this earlier lodge at Parma is confirmed by the fact that
Niccolao and Benvenuti are found working together with
Giovanni Buono at Pistoja in 1270.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes a single name stands out among the file of
Comacines, and one finds several well-known buildings that
have emanated from one mind. Such a Master was Magister
Giorgio of Jesi, near Como. His name is graven in the
stones of many a church. At Fermo on the Adriatic, a
"sumptuous" cathedral was built in 1227; a certain Bartolommeo
Mansionarius being the patron. On the left south
door was a slab with the inscription&mdash;"A.D. MCCXXVII
Bartolomeus Mansionarius Hoc opus fieri fecit Per Manus
Magistri Georgii de Episcopatu Com".... That the
mutilated word is Como we prove by a similar inscription on
the cathedral at Jesi (the ancient Æsis where the Emperor
Frederick II., grandson of Barbarossa, was born). The
ancient cathedral of S. Septimus, a truly Lombard building,
still exists in part. Here the inscription runs&mdash;"A.D.
MCCXXXVII tempore D. Gregorii Papae domini Federici
Imperatoris, et domini Severini. episcope. æsini. Magister
Georgius de Cumo civis æsinus fecit hoc opus."</p>

<p>Here we get the city as well as the bishopric to which
Magister Giorgius belonged. He was a citizen of Jesi in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the diocese of Como, and a qualified member of the higher
rank of the Comacine Guild. In the little town of Penna in
the same province, where the church was ruined in an earthquake,
an ancient stone was found with the following inscription
in old Latin&mdash;"In the name of God. Amen. This
work was commenced in the time of the Priest Gualtieri, and
completed in that of the Priest Grazia, by Master George of
Jesi in the year 1256." By these stones we find that
Master George worked in the province of Piceno for thirty
years, between Fermo, Jesi, and Penna. To him is attributed
the ancient communal palace of Jesi which was rebuilt
in the fifteenth century by other Comacine Masters.

<p>At Modena, which was once a prosperous Roman
colony, and then an independent commune, we find a most
interesting family of Comacines, who for more than two
centuries worked at the cathedral there, son succeeding
father, and nephews following their uncles as architects.
The building of a worthy church was the first thought of
the newly-made commune in 1099. In Muratori's copy of
the <i>Acts of the translation of the body of S. Gemignano to
Modena</i>, we read&mdash;"So then, in the year 1099, the inhabitants
of the said city began to demand where they could
find an architect for such a work, a builder for such a
church; and at length, by the grace of God, a certain man
named Lanfranco, a marvellous architect, was found, under
the counsels of whom the foundations of the Basilica were
laid."<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Lanfranco is a name very frequent in Lombardy, but
this man, probably from his already acquired fame, was the
same Magister Lanfrancus filius Dom. Ersatii de Livurno
(Ligurno), who built the cloister of Voltorre, near Lake
Varese, in the neighbourhood of the Antelami.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The fact
remains that all his successors were Comacines, and from
places near Ligurno. There is also a similarity of style
between the cloister at Voltorre, and the older parts of
S. Gemignano at Modena, both showing a grafting of
Gothic on the Romano-Lombard style. A curious document
exists, a kind of contract, quoted by Tiraboschi in his
<i>Codice Diplomatico</i> in the Appendix to the historical memorials
of the building of the cathedral, long after Lanfranco's
part was done. It runs, when Anglicized&mdash;"In the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
of Christ, in the year of His nativity, 1244, in the second
indiction, on the day of Mercury (Wednesday), the last of
the month of November. It has been recorded that between
Ser Alberto, once treasurer to the Opera et Fabbrica, and
the late Master Anselmo da Campione in the episcopate of
Como (<i>Magistrum Anselmum de Campilione, Episcopatus
Cumani</i>), a contract was made, by which the said Magister
and his heirs <i>in perpetuo</i> should work at the said church of
Modena, and either the said Master, or any other Master,
his descendant, should receive every day, six imperials
in the days of May, June, July, and August, but five
imperials only in those of the other months, for their recompense
and their work. Ser Ubaldino, now Administrator
of the said <i>Fabbriceria</i>, seeing and considering that the said
stipend or remuneration does not seem sufficient according
to the course of these and succeeding times, has deliberated
and taken counsel with the venerable Bishop Signor
Alberto, and with Ser Giovanni, Archpriest of Modena, at
the instance and petition of Magister Arrigo (Henry), son
of Magister Ottaccio, who was the son of Anselmo aforesaid;
and in the presence of the aforementioned Signori,
Bishop, and Archpriest, and of the subscribing witnesses,
promises and agrees that to the said Magister Arrigo, for
himself and his sons and heirs, and for Magister Alberto
and Magister Jacopo, his paternal uncles (<i>patruis suis</i>), and
the sons and heirs of the same, shall be given over and
above to them, and to their said sons, or successors, who
shall be masters in that art (<i>qui magistri fuerint hujus
artis</i>), eight imperials for each day they work, from the
calends of April to the calends of October. In the days of
the remaining months in which they shall have worked at
the will of the Administrator of the building, they should,
and shall have, only six imperials, receiving nevertheless
their food from the said lodge, not only on festal days, but
on all others, as they have from the beginning been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
accustomed to have. And if at the will of the said
Administrator they shall bring other competent Masters
necessary to the said works, these shall receive seven
imperials for each day, from the said calends of April
to those of October, but in other months only five imperials
per diem."</p>

<p>This deed was drawn up in the Canonica of Modena,
and duly signed by witnesses.</p>

<p>Tracing the predecessors of Arrigo of Campione, father
and grandfather, back from 1244, we come very near the
time of the first Lanfranco; and following his descendants
from Arrigo, head architect in 1244, to his grandson, who
finished the tower of the Dome,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and made the marble pulpit
in the cathedral in 1322, we get a family line of builders
lasting unbroken for nearly two hundred years. There still
exists an inscription in bad Latin on the cornice of the
pulpit, which says that Tomasino di Giovanni, treasurer of
the <i>Fabbriceria</i>, S. Gemignano, had the pulpit carved, and
the tower built by Arrigo or Enrico, the Campionese
sculptor (<i>actibus Henrici sculptoris campionensis</i>). It would
be difficult now to assign his due share to each of this long
line of master-builders; but the Italian critic, Marchese
Ricci, gives Lanfranco the credit of the interior, which is
in pure Romano-Lombard style, with two aisles and a
nave. The nave is much higher than the aisles, and is supported
on columns with high Corinthian capitals from some
ancient Roman temple. Lanfranco has given a clumsier
Lombard air to them by a very large abacus. The crypt
is supported on sixty columns, the capitals of which are all
Lombard, and of endless variety of form and sculpture. In
the centre is the ark (tomb) of S. Gemignano. The wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
of the façade, with its little pillared gallery, is also of
Lanfranco's time.</p>

<p>The porch, with its knotted pillars supported on lions,
is adjudged by Ricci to be the work of Anselmo of Campione
in 1209. The sculpture on the façade by Nicolaus
and Guglielmo is said to date from early in the twelfth
century, and probably belonged to Lanfranco's design
before Anselmo put this doorway. They are to our eyes
most naïve Bible stories told in rude sculpture&mdash;the one
side representing the Creation, the other the first men as
far as Noah. To contemporary eyes, however, they were
great works, for an old grandiloquent low Latin inscription
on the façade says&mdash;"Inter scultores quanto sis dignus
honore Claret scultura nunc Viligelme tua." "Worthy of
honour art thou among sculptors. So shines, O William,
this thy sculpture." Marchese Ricci, from the peculiar
spelling of Guglielmo, thinks that he might have been
a German, but as in the Ferrara inscription he is spelt
in the Italian way, I think the Viligelme may be only
one of those queer reversals of consonants so common in
illiterate Italians. If a poor Florentine has a son named
Arturo, he will surely call him Alturo, or if Alfredo, he will
always be Arfledo. In any way we can descry in this artist,
as in many others of his age, the forerunner of Niccolò
Pisano, and see in the art of Niccolò only a link in development,
not a new art entirely. To Nicolaus and Guglielmo
are also attributed the sculptures in the choir, representing
the Passion. We shall find them again at Ferrara.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the family of Anselmo, hereditary
sculptors and architects of Modena, were certainly the
founders of the great school of the Campionese, which
lasted some centuries, and to whose hands may be attributed
nearly all the great churches in North Italy. The
schools, <i>laborerium</i>, and <i>fabbricerie</i> of Modena furnish
another prototype of the threefold organization, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
becomes so distinct in the Opera of Florence and the
Lodges of Venice, Siena, and Orvieto. Tiraboschi publishes
a notarial Act, dated January 7, 1261, which speaks
of the <i>laborerium</i> near the Duomo, where the stones for
the fabric were carved; and that there was a covered way
between the church and this building which must not be
removed or changed.</p>

<p>Gerolamo Calvi, in his <i>Matteo de Campione, architetto
e scultore</i>, says that nearly all the architecture and sculpture
executed in and around Milan in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries may be attributed to the Campionesi.
He instances the Sala della Ragione at Padua, with its
enormous span of roof, its characteristic arcades and galleries,
and the Loggia degli Assi, or Loggia del Consiglio,
once the Podestà's palace; the church of S. Agostino at
Bergamo, built by Ugo da Campione and his son Giovanni,
the castle of the Visconti at Pavia, and many others.
Campione, though a place of importance in Roman times,
and cited in Carlovingian documents, is now only a village
on the side of a mountain, near Val d'Intelvi, containing
500 inhabitants. Calvi writes of it that from the earliest
times before the renaissance of art,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> the men of Campione
dedicated themselves to building and sculpture, and diffused
themselves throughout the north of Italy, working rudely
at first, but gaining in style and experience till they produced
great works worthy of eternal fame.</p>

<p>It seems probable that in this school we have a link
with Florence. The Jacopo de Campione, who was mentioned
in 1244 as uncle of the petitioner Arrigo, is named
in other documents as a Campionese, is thought by Merzario
and other authors to be that famous architect, Jacopo il
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Tedesco&mdash;or the Lombard, who was for centuries taken with
certainty to be the father of Arnolfo. We shall speak of
his pedigree in another chapter.</p>

<p>The builders of the Duomo of Ferrara were decidedly
connected with the <i>laborerium</i> at Modena, both lodges
originating from the Campione school. The façade has the
usual three perpendicular divisions formed by means of
chiselled shafts, but each division is divided horizontally
into three levels, each one enriched with Lombard galleries.
Besides these is a wealth of ornamentation, figures, reliefs,
<i>trafori</i> (open work), and foliage of the most fantastic kind.
This and the framework of the church are all that remain
of the Comacine work, excepting the vestibule, which has
all their signs on it. Four columns resting on four red
marble lions support it; one of them guards a lamb, and
another has a serpent beneath its paw. Here we have still
the Comacine mysticism: the lion of Judah guarding the
Paschal Lamb, and one of the House of Judah crushing
the serpent. Over the porch are more sculptures, and an
arched vestibule; over that a kind of Gothic gable, and
above the gable a rose window. The whole speaks eloquently
of its kinship with the churches of Verona, Parma,
and Bergamo. Tradition says the interior and façade were
built not much later than 1103. The inscription over the
door runs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Il mille cento trempta nato. Fo questo templo a Zorzi
(Giorgio) consacrato. Fo Nicolao scultore, e Ghelmo fo lo
auctore." These are evidently the same Guglielmo and
Nicolao who sculptured Lanfranco's front at Modena.
Guglielmo was the leading man, and made the design
(<i>auctore</i>); Nicolaus chiefly executed it.</p>

<p>But these two were not the only Comacines employed at
Ferrara; a MS. copy of an ancient inscription on some old
reliefs in the front of the church of St. George, records the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
names of Meo and Antonio of Como. "Da Meo di Checco,
e da Antonio di Frix. da Como."<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Before the middle of the thirteenth century, Padua had
become the shrine of a miraculous saint. St. Anthony had
come over from Lisbon in 1220, and founded at Padua a
new order of monks, called <i>Minori Conventuali</i>, under
similar rules to the Franciscans. St. Anthony attracted
great crowds of people by his preaching and miracles, and
at his death in 1231 he was canonized, and his devotees
desired to build a beautiful church over his tomb. The
first attempt failed from not having means to pay a good
architect, or competent builders, and in 1265 the commune
set to work to remedy their mistake. They assigned four
thousand lire a year to the re-edification, until such
time as the church should be completed. By 1307
all was complete except the cupola, which was added a
century later. Vasari attributes the design to Niccolò
Pisano; but his able commentator, Milanesi, who lived all
his life studying archives, asserts that neither document,
inscription, nor tradition remain to prove Niccolò's connection
with Padua, while the style of the building is utterly
unlike the edifices known to be his.</p>

<p>Some documents in the archives of Padua, unearthed by
Padre Gonzali, prove that in 1263, on May 11, there were
working in the church as builders, Egidio, son of Magister
Gracii; Ubertino, son of Lanfranco; Niccola, son of Giovanni;
and Pergandi, son of Ugone of Mantua; and that, in 1264,
a Zambono of Como and a Benedetto of Verona, who lived
in the district of Rovina, are recorded as builders. There
is no record of the architect who designed the church; but
judging from the Moorish innovations of style it was very
probably either planned by the monks, or designed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
them. St. Anthony was a Portuguese. On his way here
he would have passed through Spain, and may have been
attracted by the Moorish architecture. He may have even
brought a drawing or two of some many-domed building,
and have given them to the Lombard architects to work
from. Probably some of his monks were&mdash;like many Franciscans
and Dominicans&mdash;members of the Guild of Freemasons,
and so trained in the science of architecture.</p>

<p>In any case, the buildings at Padua are neither true
Lombard nor true Gothic, and not even Oriental, but a
mixture of all three. The Lombard has partly had his way
in the façade, where the upper part is full of galleries and
archlets; the lover of the new Gothic arches has put his
mark on the lower part of the façade; and the monks, who
remembered the native land of their saint, have put the
seven domes and minarets; the domes, however, were
beyond the Comacines of that time, and were not placed till
the fifteenth century, when it is to be imagined that the
Renaissance doorway and various pilasters and adjuncts
were added. Altogether, for a church where Como Masters
undoubtedly worked, St. Anthony of Padua is the most
unlike their style. They seem to have taken so little
interest in the outlandish plan, that they did not sanctify it
by a bit of their biblical sculpture.</p>

<p>That monks at that era really did occupy themselves in
architecture, we have consistent proofs in the monkish
builders of fine churches; and that when they followed this
branch, they were probably trained in, and became members
of, the great Masonic Guild, is also indicated by the close
connection between the <i>Magistri-frati</i> and the secular
<i>Magistri</i>. In the transactions of the guild, monks were
frequently called into council by the <i>Opera</i> or <i>Fabbriceria</i>;
and they often worked at their churches in conjunction with
the secular members.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148"  class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In the church of S. Francesco at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Lodi is an interesting old painting, representing S.
Bernardino directing a group of monks engaged in building

</div>

<p>It is through this order at Padua that the link with
Germany became strengthened. Albertus Magnus was a
Dominican, born in Bavaria. He came to Padua for his
studies in theology and the exact sciences, which evidently
included the science of building. Merzario says that up to
1223 he taught publicly in Padua, and wrote a work on
Perspective.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"  class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Don Vincenzo Rossi, Prior of Settignano, however,
writes to me, I believe on the authority of Montalembert,
that Albertus Magnus attended the university at Padua, and
some think also that at Pavia, but only as a student. He
held a <i>cattedra</i> at Cologne, where St. Thomas of Aquinas
was his pupil.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"  class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The name of Albertus Magnus is much connected with
the Freemasonry of Germany; and soon after his stay in
Padua we find Comacine Masters working in Germany.
Some German <i>savant</i> might work out this clue, and see if
he did not start, or aid in establishing, a lodge at Cologne,
for all authors agree that the architectural <i>Maestranze</i>
(as the Italians called the mixed clerical and lay Masonic
Guilds) passed over the Alps from Italy, and flourished
greatly in northern cities, such as Strasburg, Zurich,
Cologne, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century the beautiful church and monastery
of Chiaravalle, near Milan, were erected by the Campionese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Masters, on the commission of the noble family of Archinto
of Milan. It is a fine specimen of Italian Gothic, with the
dome peculiar to that style.</p>

<p>The Visconti of Milan were large patrons of the
Campionese school. The fine castle at Pavia, built in the
time of Galeazzo II., shows by its style the Comacine hand.
It has been assigned to Niccola Sella from Arezzo and
Bernardo of Venice, but, as Merzario shows, these men only
came to Pavia thirty years after it was finished.</p>

<p>The first stone was laid on March 27, 1360. The
archives have been searched in vain to find the architect's
name: it is, however, proved that Bonino da Campione
was in Pavia in 1362, working at the Area di S. Agostino,
so it is probable that some of his brethren of the Campionese
school were also employed by Galeazzo. Unluckily,
these are so individually sunk in the company, that one
rarely gets a prominent name.</p>

<p>Merzario, quoting other writers, attributes to the
Campionesi that sepulchral monument of Beatrice della
Scala, now in the church of S. Maria at Milan; the mausoleum
of Stefano Visconti in S. Eustorgio, and that of Azzo,
son of Galeazzo I.; but beyond a tradition that Bonino da
Campione sculptured the last, there is no positive proof.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152"  class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Great conjectures have been made as to the real author
of the Arca di Agostino at Pavia. Vasari says&mdash;"La quale
è di mano <i>secondo che a me pare</i> di Agnolo e Agostino,
scultori senesi." His expression, "As it seems to me," is
not very decisive proof, truly. Cicognara is not more
exact. He "wonders that this most grand and magnificent
work is not more famous than it is&mdash;and thinks it shows
the style of the Sienese brothers, but opines it is more
likely to be by some pupil of theirs, if it is not by Pietro
Paolo and Jacobello the Venetians." This is vague with a
vengeance. Merzario, however, proves that there are no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
documents to show that the Sienese brother sculptors ever
came to Pavia, and asserts that the style of the Arca is not
at all Venetian.</p>

<p>The learned Difendente Sacchi<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153"  class="fnanchor">[153]</a> brings more logic and
less imagination to bear on the point. The inscription on
the monument proves that it was begun in 1362, placed in
1365, and that the accessory ornamentation was finished in
1370. The books of the administration show that the sums
paid for its construction amounted in all to seventy-two
thousand <i>lire italiane</i>.</p>

<p>As no artist in especial is named as having received this
sum, I should myself imagine that as usual several Masters of
the guild worked at it, but that one was <i>capo maestro</i>, and
drew the design. Comparing it with the monument of Can
della Scala at Verona, which is a certified work of Bonino
da Campione, Sacchi argues that he was the designer and
sculptor of this Arca. The style in both is semi-Gothic,
the arches following the same curve and resting on columns;
the friezes and ornaments are so much alike as to be in
some parts identical in design; the crown of pyramids and
<i>cupolini</i> which finishes the monument on the top, the form
of the pinnacles, and their floriations are more than similar.</p>

<p>The Arca di S. Agostino is, however, the more elaborate.
It has ninety-five statues in its niches, not counting statuettes.
One may count nearly three hundred distinct works
of sculpture in the composition. (Would not this redundancy
prove it the work of a school rather than one hand?)
Sacchi justly observes that if Can Scaliger confided to
Bonino the commission for his monument, it must have
been because he had seen proofs of his skill; and where
could this have been more probable than in the Arca at
Milan?</p>

<p>A suggestive proof of the Arca di S. Agostino being
the joint work of the Comacine Guild, is suggested by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Merzario.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"  class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Over the colonnade of the Arca are twelve
statues, but in front of these stand the <i>Quattro Santi
Coronati</i>, the four artist martyrs. One of these is represented
stooping to examine the base of a pillar; another
trying the diminution of a column with the T square, and a
third measures a reversed capital, and holds a scroll on
which is written in Gothic letters, <i>Quatuor Coronatorum</i>;
the fourth is working with hammer and chisel.</p>

<p>Now these four saints, being the special patrons of the
Comacine Guild, would have little significance to any other
artists.</p>

<p>The sepulchre of Can Signorio de Scaliger in Verona
was begun in his lifetime, and on his own commission, and
cost 10,000 gold florins. He died in 1375, so it must date
slightly prior to that. <i>Bonino de Campiglione Mediolanensis</i>
has signed his name in marble on the frieze. It is a fine
specimen of Gothic ornamentation, at the culmination of
the Campionese school.</p>

<p>There were also earlier works of Bonino's at Cremona;
one a sepulchre to Folchino de Schicci, a jurisconsult, in
the chapel of St. Catherine in the Duomo, beautifully
worked with friezes, etc., in bas-reliefs. It is signed in
Gothic characters&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

THE TUSCAN LINK</h3>

<p class="center p2">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pisa</span></p>

<p>The very mention of Pisa brings to our minds Niccolò
Pisano, whose name stands in all art histories as the
fountain-head of that Tuscan development of art which
led to the Renaissance. But where was Niccolò Pisano
trained and qualified for this high post of honour? A
great architect and sculptor does not suddenly become
famous and obtain important commissions without having
some undeniable credentials.</p>

<p>In those mediæval days, when the arts protected themselves
by forming into constituted guilds, no one could call
himself a Master unless he were trained and qualified in
one of these guilds and had reached the higher grades.
To trace Niccolò's place in the great chain of the Masonic
Guild, we must go back a little, and gather together the
threads of information we have been able to glean, as to
the expansion of the guild itself, and here the valuable
collections of archivial documents made by Sig. Milanesi
from the books and archives of the Opera del Duomo at
Siena, and by Sig. Cesare Guasti from those of the cathedral
at Florence, will materially assist us. By studying these
and putting facts and statements together the whole organization
becomes clear, and our former glimpses into the
threefold aspect of the lodges at Modena, Parma, and other
northern cities become confirmed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>Here in Tuscany we again find the three branches.
First: There is the school where novices were trained in
the three sister arts&mdash;painting, sculpture, and architecture.
When pupils were received from outside the guild, they
had to pass a very severe novitiate before being admitted
as members; but the sons and nephews of <i>Magistri</i> were,
we learn, entitled to be members by heritage without the
novitiate.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"  class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The hereditary aspect of the lists of Masters
certainly displays this right of heritage very strongly. The
qualified Masters were entitled to take pupils and apprentices
in their own studios. The large number of pupils
who studied under Niccolò Pisano suggests his eminent
position in the guild.</p>

<p>Second: There was the <i>laborerium</i>, or great workshop,
where all the hewing of stone, carving of columns, cutting up
of wood-work was done&mdash;in fact, the head-quarters of the
brethren who had passed the schools, but were not yet
Masters.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"  class="fnanchor">[157]</a> A graphic sketch from a Masonic <i>laborerium</i> is
given by Nanni di Banco, in the relief under the shrine
of the <i>Quattro Coronati</i> on Or San Michele at Florence,
where the four brethren are all at work. In looking at it,
one is reminded of the old story of the block of marble
from which Michael Angelo's David was made, which had
laid for many years in the stores of the Opera del Duomo
at Florence, it having been once assigned to Agostino di
Ducci, who was commissioned in 1464 to make a statue for
the front of the Duomo, which was blocked out so badly
that the marble was taken away from him, and he was
expelled from the <i>laborerium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158"  class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Third: There was the <i>Opera</i> or Office of Administration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
which formed the link between the guild and its
patrons. The Freemasons evidently adapted their nomenclature
to the dialect of the part they were in. In Tuscany
the word for this office was <i>Opera</i> (or Works). There
was the Opera di S. Jacopo at Pistoja as early as 1100;
and the Opera del Duomo at Pisa, Siena, and Florence.
In cities of the Lombard district, such as Modena, Parma,
Padua, Milan, etc., the name is <i>Fabbriceria</i>. The
members of this Ruling Council are generally four in
number, and are called <i>Operai</i> in Tuscany, and
<i>Fabbricieri</i> in Lombardy. These were elected periodically,
two of them being influential citizens, who acted on
the part of the patrons, and two from the Masters themselves.
Where the lodge was very small there was only
one <i>operaio</i>, as in Pistoja, when in 1250 Turrisianus was
overseer (<i>superstans</i>) for a year. Later, when the Pistoja
lodge was larger, there were two. At Milan there were
more than four. Above these was the <i>Superiore</i>, a sort
of president. If there were a reigning Prince, he was
usually elected president. In the <i>Opera</i>, all commissions
were given, and contracts signed between the city and the
Masters, every contract being duly drawn up in legal
manner by the notary of the <i>Opera</i>. Here orders were given
for the purchase of materials, and estimates considered for
the payment of either work or goods. The <i>Opera</i> had to
provide the funds for the whole expenses. Usually this
was done in the first instance by appropriating to the work
the receipts of one or more taxes. In course of time people
left legacies, and the <i>Opera</i> had a knack of growing very
rich.</p>

<p>Between the <i>Opera</i> and the <i>laborerium</i> was a responsible
officer called the <i>Provveditore</i>. Judging from
the entries in his private memorandum-book, his responsibilities
must have been endless, and his occupations
multitudinous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>There was also a treasurer, a secretary, and two
<i>Probiviri</i>, sometimes called <i>Buon uomini</i>, who acted as
arbiters, for purposes of appeal and verification of accounts.</p>

<p>The identical form of the lodges in the different cities
is a strong argument that the same ruling body governed
them all. An argument equally strong is the ubiquity of
the members. We find the same man employed in one
lodge after another, as work required. Unfortunately no
documents exist of the early Lombard times, but the
archives of the <i>Opere</i>, which in most cities have been
faithfully kept since the thirteenth century, would, if
thoroughly examined, prove to be valuable stores from
which to draw a history of the Masonic Guild.</p>

<p>We will now return to Pisa.</p>

<p>Sig. Merzario asserts that no school of art indigenous to
Pisa existed there before the building of the Duomo. He
might almost have said before the time of Niccolò, for so
far was the half-mythical Buschetto from being a Pisan,
that the world has for eight centuries been arguing where
he came from! To arrive at Niccolò it is necessary to
start from Buschetto. Who was Buschetto? Whence came
he? Vasari, in his ignorance of monumental Latin, says,
"From Dulichium," and thus the idea was promulgated
that he was a Greek. But the inscription (given on next
page) on Pisa cathedral says nothing of the kind. It is a
flowery eloquence which Cavalier Del Borgo reads as
comparing him for genius to Ulysses, Duke of Dulichium,
and for skill to Dædalus.</p>

<p>Cicognara judges from his name that he was Italian.
Most probably Buschetto was a nickname, "little bush,"
given him either from a shock head of hair, or derived from
<i>Buscare</i>, to thrash or flog. It is quite possible, though
the proofs are not very strong, that he may have been of
Greek extraction, descended from some of the Byzantine
members of the guild of whom we have spoken before.

</div></div>

<p>The partisans of the Grecian theory hold much to a MS.
said to be now in the archives of the Vatican,&mdash;but which
Milanesi asserts cannot be found,&mdash;which says that the
Pisans "<i>Buschetum ex Grecia favore Constantinopolitani
Imperatoris obtinuerunt</i>." Morrona also suspects this to be
apocryphal; but even if it be genuine, the Pisans may only
have asked for one of the Italian architects who were working
in large numbers in the East under the Emperors, and
building Lombard churches on Oriental ground. It was
only in 1170 that Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino,
begged Comnenus to send him back some architects, and
the Italian sculptor Olinto was among them.</p>

<p>It may well be true, as Sig. Merzario says, that no school
existed at Pisa before the Duomo was begun. But soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
after that, we certainly find the usual organization of
<i>laborerium</i> and <i>Opera</i>.</p>

<p>Old authors tell us that "the most famous Masters from
foreign parts vied in lending their help to the building of
such an important edifice, under the direction of Buschetto."<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162"  class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Another old MS.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163"  class="fnanchor">[163]</a> records that the "Opera of the Duomo
was instituted in 1080, some years after Buschetto was
engaged, and that the first <i>operai</i> of the Council were
Hildebrand, son of the Judge Uberto, son of Leo, Signoretto
Alliata, and Buschetto of Dulichium who was architect.
The head of these was Hildebrand, and the others were
ministers and officers of the Opera, as may be found in the
archives of the said Opera."<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164"  class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Here we have the full
organization of the Comacine House of Works. The dignitaries
of the city as President, Treasurer, and Ministers,
the head architect also a member of the Council of the
Opera. Another old writer calls Buschetto <i>capo della
scuola Pisana</i>.</p>

<p>Niccolò, Giovanni, and Andrea da Pisa are fine proofs
that the school at Pisa flourished and brought forth brave
artists. Even as late as the sixteenth century, when Sansovino
was sculpturing the casing of the Holy House at Loreto,
we are told that thirty of the best carvers in stone were
sent from Pisa to work under the Capo Maestro, Andrea
Contucci of Monte Sansovino.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165"  class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Among the <i>Magistri</i> from other parts in Buschetto's time,
one of the chief was doubtless Rainaldo, who, judging from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the inscription near the principal door of the façade, was
not only a working sculptor in the guild, but also a full-fledged
Master&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>HOC OPUS EXIMIUM TAM MERUM TAM PRETIOSUM:</p>
<p>RAINALDUS PRUDENS OPERATOR, ET IPSE MAGISTER:</p>
<p>COSTITVIT MIRE, SOLLERTER, ET INGENIOSE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is much to be deplored that this inscription bears no
date, so that we cannot tell whether Rainaldo were chief
architect after Buschetto, or whether he were only sculptor
and executed the front; Buschetto being architect, and
designing the whole. Here we have several things to
suggest both these artists as Italians, (1) Their names.
(2) The Comacine form of their institutions, with the <i>Opera</i>
at the head. (3) The concourse of Italian <i>Magistri</i> which
followed them; but as usual, absolute proof is wanting.</p>

<p>Let us see if their work can throw more light on the
question. Is the Pisan church Byzantine? Decidedly not.
There are no domes except the central one, which is seen
in most Lombard churches; no Oriental arches resting on
bulging capitals; but round arches supported on the identical
Romano-Lombard composite capitals one sees in every
Italian church of the time. The façade too is a very
wilderness of Lombard galleries in every direction. Instead
of following the line of roof, they cover the whole front, one
below another. If Buschetto had brought back from
Byzantium an idea of more richness of ornamentation, he
certainly worked it out in Italian forms, by merely multiplying
his little pillared galleries till a network was formed
over the whole building. This was not confined to him;
it became a mark of Comacine work for the next two or
three centuries, as we may see at Lucca, Ancona, Arezzo,
and other places. The style is called Romanesque, and it
stands between the heavier Lombard style of the earlier
Comacines, and the more finished Italian Gothic of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
later ones, as shown in Florence and Milan. They are all,
however, only different developments of the same guild.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_295" id="i_295"></a>
<img src="images/i_295.jpg" width="516" height="371" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Interior of Pisa Cathedral, 11th century.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_212">See page 212.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The richness of ornamentation suited the temper of the
Pisans at that time. They were proud of many victories,
and had brought back from Majorca, Palermo, and other
places, various spoils, such as porphyry colonnettes, rare
marble, etc. etc.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"  class="fnanchor">[166]</a> They desired a particularly grand and
gorgeous church, and that it should be in a style hitherto
unknown. The many antique capitals and columns among
the spoils placed at his disposal suggested, of course, arches,
so by way of being very original, Buschetto or Rainaldo,
whichever of the two designed it, made his façade with four
arcades, instead of one, or two, as his brethren in the north
were accustomed to do. The colonnettes in these four galleries
are fifty-eight in number, some of <i>rosso antico</i>, others
of the black and gold-streaked Luna marble. The two large
columns at the central door are also of antique Greek work;
they are beautifully carved in foliage intertwined; the other
four columns are fluted and wreathed with foliage. The
capitals also are chiefly ancient classic work; there are
Corinthian and composite ones. The remaining capitals are
Comacine work, and have their usual mixture of animals
and hieroglyphic figures. Here, too, are the lions of Judah
in juxtaposition with the pillars, but as yet they appear
above the pillar and not beneath it, as was the invariable
custom a century later.</p>

<p>The rude figures of saints at the extremities of the roof,
both of the aisles and nave, mark the beginning of that
revival of the human figure in sculpture, which was the
forerunner of the work of Niccolò Pisano. The tower and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Baptistery are the natural results of the Duomo, the style
being identical; the same round arches in the foundation,
and the same circles of Lombard galleries covering the
super-structures.</p>

<p>The Baptistery was built by Magister Diotisalvi, somewhere
about 1152. We have no proofs of his origin, but
his work and title prove him to have graduated in the same
guild as Buschetto and Rainaldo,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"  class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and we find his son and
grandsons in Siena and other lodges.</p>

<p>In the Baptistery, the old mystic octagonal form was
abandoned, and the circle takes its place. Diotisalvi has
here made a perfect bell in tone as well as in form. It is
the most acoustic building possible, as any one may prove by
singing in rotation the notes of a chord. The whole chord
echoes on for several moments with exquisite effect. The
Baptistery was begun in August 1152, the first stone being
laid in the presence of the Consul Cocco di Tacco Grifi;
and two of the <i>Operai</i> (members of the administrative
council or <i>Opera</i>) named Cinetto Cinetti, and Arrigo
Cancellieri, were appointed <i>soprastanti</i> (overseers). Here
again we have a distinct connection between the <i>Opera del
Duomo</i> and the <i>laborerium</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the classic spoils of war were given to Diotisalvi
for this building. Several of the capitals on the twenty
columns supporting the foundation circle of round arches,
are Corinthian; and the two pillars at the chief portal are
beautiful specimens of ancient work, similar to those in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
façade of the Duomo. Between the classic remains incorporated
into the building, and the statues and sculptures
which belong to a later century, it is difficult to distinguish
which were the absolute work of Diotisalvi himself. The
sculptures on the door-jambs&mdash;rather mediæval scenes
relating to Christ and David&mdash;and the hieroglyphics of the
months were probably his own work. The Baptism of
Christ on the architrave, which has the mediæval expression
of baptism by immersion, may be his; and if so, it
seems to explain how the Greek element got into Niccolò
di Pisa's work, for here is his antecedent of a century,
showing in his work signs of the same leaning to classicism
in the midst of a rude and early style. How could he help
it when he was living among classic remains of sculpture?</p>

<p>The other three doors have also antique spiral columns
of Greek marble. A fine piece of work, in Comacine style,
is the frieze of interlaced foliage over the west entrance.
The second order is a colonnade of fifty-eight arches with
sculptured capitals. The third consists of eighteen pilasters
and twenty windows. Here are seen the lion between the
pillar and the arch, various animals and human heads at
the spring of the arches, while above each order is a
complicated cornice of pyramids, spires, and arabesques,
which suggest a Southern or Eastern influence. The interior
is less ornate, but of fine solid architecture. Twelve Corinthian
columns and four large pilasters support the arches,
forming a peristyle round the building; a similar gallery
with slight columns runs above it. The columns are not all
of antique marble. Three of them are of granite brought
from the Isle of Elba, on May 4, 1155, and two from Sardinia,
by Cinetti, one of the overseers we have mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168"  class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
The first pillar was placed on October 1, 1156. The
capitals are ornate; some antique, Corinthian, others in
Comacine style with animals and <i>intrecci</i>. On one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
pillars is engraved&mdash;"Deo-ti-salvi, magister hujus operis."
Morrona thinks the Baptistery shows a Moorish influence.
This is possible, as the whole of the three buildings show
the Comacines' first great change of style, after their works
in the south at Palermo, and the kingdom of Naples.</p>

<p>Old writers call the style Arabo-Tedesco; and this
brings us to the meaning of the word <i>Tedesco</i> in Italian
architecture at this epoch.</p>

<p>The fallacy that the Italian Gothic came from Germany,
must have got into art histories from a misconception of
Vasari's term of opprobrium, "<i>quei Tedeschi</i>." He uses it
when he speaks of any architecture which is not purely
classic, even blaming buildings such as Arnolfo's Florentine
dome, the churches of Assisi, Orvieto, Lucca,
Pisa, etc.</p>

<p>But the writers who interpret this term as meaning
the German nation, are reasoning on a fallacy. In the
first place, was there any pointed Gothic in Germany before
the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries? We will just run
over the principal Gothic cathedrals. Bruges was begun
in 1358; Cologne is modern of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries; Lubeck was built in 1341; Attenburg in 1265-1379;
Freiburg Dom Kirche in 1484. At Freiburg in
Breisgau, the older parts are of the same style as Comacine,
while the Gothic parts date from 1513; Strasburg, the
Gothic parts between 1318-1439; Magdeburg, 1363.</p>

<p>Before these were built we have at Cologne, S. Gereon's
Kirche, with circular arches, date 1227, and S. Pantaleon,
980, but there is not a sign of Gothic in either. Bonn cathedral,
built in 1151-1270, is also round-arched. Coblenz
is Carlovingian. Mayence, round-arched of the tenth
and eleventh centuries (the Gothic side-chapels date from
1260 to 1500). Treves, with round arches, early Romanesque
of the eleventh century; choir, later Romanesque of
the twelfth century; some parts which are pointed were of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the thirteenth century. Hildesheim, a Romanesque Basilica,
built in the eleventh century. Dom Insel at Breslau, 1170,
is tripartite, on the Comacine plan, and very quaint.
Worms, 996-1016, Lombard style, with round arches; the
parts with pointed architecture are much more modern.
This list proves that the earliest churches were built by
Italian Masters, or at least in the Italian style.</p>

<p>Indeed Hope classes most of them as Lombard. The
Germans themselves expanded the Lombard style into the
pointed, which also came up through Italy, its first signs
being seen at Assisi, next at Pisa, and then Florence.</p>

<p>Milan was a later reflex of the perfected German Gothic,
though chiefly executed, as we shall see later, by the hands
of Comacine Masters.</p>

<p>As I have before remarked, climatic influences greatly
determine the style of a national architecture. To the
sunny south belong the flat roof; the shady colonnade;
the horizontal line and frieze; the fountained court; the
smaller windows; and the solid tower. To the north the
pointed roof, that snow and rain shall not decay it; the
solid buttress to resist the greater outward pressure of the
high and aspiring sloped roof; the perpendicular tendency
in design; the larger windows for a less sunny atmosphere;
and the pointed spire to carry up the general lines.</p>

<p>On these lines of fitness the Germans and French perfected
their style, and imported it into England. The
differences are great, between this northern Gothic and the
Italian Gothic, which is always more or less Romanesque.
Now if in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"  class="fnanchor">[169]</a> the Germans
had not begun to build their glorious pointed minsters,
what did Vasari mean by <i>quei Tedeschi</i>? I will show from
his own description. In his chapter called "<i>dell' Architettura</i>,"
forming the introduction to his <i>Lives</i>, after discussing the
three classical orders, he says (I will translate literally)&mdash;"There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
is another kind of work which they call <i>Tedesco</i>
(German), in which the ornamentation and proportions are
very different from the ancient or the modern. (Modern
in Vasari's time would be the Renaissance style of Michael
Angelo.) This is not used by good architects of these days,
but is shunned by them as monstrous and barbarous.
Every sign of order is forgotten, it ought rather to be
called confusion and disorder. In the buildings, which are
so many that they have infected the whole world, you see
the portals adorned with thin columns twisted like a vine,
and so slight that they could not be supposed to support
the weight. And then on their façades and other places
they made a cursed mass of little tabernacles (archlets) one
on the other, with many pyramids and points, and such
foliage (here Vasari evidently has his eye on Pisa Baptistery),
that it seems impossible how they clung together;
they seem made of paper, rather than of stone or marble.
In these works there are many protuberances, broken
lines, brackets, and <i>intrecci</i>, quite disproportionate to the
building; and frequently, by piling one thing on another,
they run up so high that the top of a door touches the roof.
(Here Vasari is certainly thinking of the porches of San
Zeno at Verona, and the cathedral of Bergamo.) This
style was invented by the Goths (does he mean Longobards
perhaps?), who having ruined the buildings, and murdered
the architects, made the ones who remained build in this
way. They arched their roofs with acute <i>quarti</i> (vaulted
roofs) and filled all Italy with this cursed style of building....
God save any country from coming to such ideas and
orders of architecture, which, being utterly deformed and
unlike the beauty of our buildings, do not deserve that we
should speak any more of them."</p>

<p>Again, in the <i>Proemio delle Vite</i>, when praising the solid
buildings of the Goths in Ravenna, especially the tomb of
Theodoric, with its huge monolithic roof, he goes on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
speak of the Dark Ages&mdash;"After which," he says, "there
arose new architects, who from their barbarous nation
derived the kind of buildings which we of to-day call
<i>tedeschi</i>, the which seem ridiculous to us, although to them
they may have appeared to be praiseworthy."</p>

<p>Here are tirades from the old chronicler of art, who
swore by the three classic orders, and worshipped Michael
Angelo and the Renaissance style! Certainly the flat
pilaster, triangular pediments, and straight unadorned lines
of that art were as far removed as the poles from the florid
but meaningful sculpture-architecture of the Comacines in
Romanesque times, or its rich Norman and Gothic developments.</p>

<p>However, we gather plainly from this, that when Vasari
calls a master <i>Tedesco</i>, he means merely Lombard. The
reason is easy to see. Lombardy and North Italy, down
to Lucca, were from about 1170 under the rule of the
German Emperors, consequently the Comacines were no
longer Lombards, nor French as in the Carlovingian times,
but Germans.</p>

<p>This is curiously emphasized by an episode in the
building of the cathedral at Pisa. When the Pisans wanted
to endow the building fund of the church, they wished to
buy some land on the Serchio, near Lucca, to help to form
a revenue. They had, however, to send Gualando Orlandi
and Aldebrando de' Visconti as ambassadors to Germany
to obtain permission from the Emperor Henry IV., that the
lands close by Lucca might be ceded to Pisa.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"  class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The tower of Pisa is too well known to need any
description here. The joint masters were Bonanno of Pisa,
and a very confusing <i>Tedesco</i>. In some authors he is
called Giovanni d'Innspruck, in others Guglielmo from
Germany. On inquiry as to how Innspruck comes into the
question, we find the following perplexing passage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Morrona. After quoting the inscription on the tower,
"A.D. MCLXXIV campanile hoc fuit fundatum mense
Agusti," he continues&mdash;"We find from ancient documents
belonging to the <i>Opera</i>, that the building was begun on
the vigil of San Lorenzo, and the two above-mentioned
architects (Bonanno and Guglielmo) are precisely indicated,
excepting only that instead of <i>Guglielmo Tedesco</i>, it is
written <i>Giovanni Onnipotente of Germany</i>&mdash;a misinterpretation
of the word &OElig;nipons or &OElig;nipontanus, which signifies
native of Innspruck."<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171"  class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The italics are my own, and emphasize
what Sig. Morrona styles a precise indication! The
passage is an astounding bit of unreason, but as neither
Giovanni nor Guglielmo is a German form of name, I
do not think this theory need trouble us. Whether the
builder were German or Italian, whether named John or
William, he only carried out the general design of the two
buildings, and made a veil of Lombard archlets all over his
leaning tower.</p>

<p>We shall find both Bonanno and Guglielmo working at
Orvieto some time later. The tower was finished much
later, when Andrea di Pisa was Grand Master of the Pisan
Lodge; the upper circle of arches belongs to his part of the
work.</p>

<p>At Pisa then we have an artistic sphere which might
well have produced Niccolò di Pisa, even without the influences
of the south. We will, as far as the few inscriptions
and documents allow, see who were the members of this
Masonic lodge, which had painters before even the rise of
the Siena school, and whose building was the earliest model
for the Romanesque style.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>Bonanno, who assisted in the building of the tower, was
more famous in the guild for his metal working than for
architecture and marble sculpture. The fame of the bronze
doors of the Duomo which he cast is now only traditionary,
as they were destroyed by the fire on October 25, 1596.
The antique inscription has been preserved, and proves
that in 1180 Bonanno cast the doors, which had taken
him a year to model, and that a certain "Benedict" was
<i>operarius</i> at the time.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"  class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Bonanno's successor as a master in bronze was a certain
Bartolommeo di Pisa, who was, like Bonanno, sculptor,
architect, and metal-worker. He was much patronized by
the Emperor Frederic, for whom he built the palace at
Foggia, and made a tomb. He seems to have been a
famous bell-caster; there are inscriptions quoted by
Morrona,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"  class="fnanchor">[173]</a> which have been found on bells in the leaning
tower of Pisa, the bells of the churches of St. Francis at
Assisi, S. Francesco at Siena, S. Paolo a Ripa d'Arno, and
S. Cosimo at Pisa, S. Michele at Lucca, etc. Sometimes
his name stands alone; sometimes one of his sons, Lotteringo
or Andreotti, is associated with him. Later we find
the sons' names alone in independent works, and then with
the distinctive title of <i>Magister</i>.</p>

<p>Through this group of Pisan Masters a special connection
was established with the south, a link which might
account for Pietro, the father of Niccolò, being called Pietro
da Apulia, for there certainly was an offshoot of the Pisan
lodge in that part. Bonanno of Pisa cast the famous
bronze doors of Monreale; Bartolommeo was at Foggia;
and his son, Magister Lotoringus, passed most of his life
at Cefalù, where his name appears on a bell dated <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1263.
The Emperor Frederic, his father's patron, nationalized
him in Cefalù, and after ten years of residence, in 1242 he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
gave him permission to take a wife from Castro-Vetere in
Calabria.</p>

<p>Other metal-workers and bell-casters at Pisa were a
Nanni, a Pardo Nardi, and others whose names appear
inscribed in the twelfth century. I do not know whether
the Angelo Rossi, whose name with the date 1173 is on
a sculptured bell once in the church of S. Giovanni in
Pisa (now at Villa di Pugnano), was a fellow-pupil or
scholar of Bonanno's. His work is less artistic and
masterly.</p>

<p>And now for the sculptors of the lodge. A famous
master of the twelfth century was Biduinus, who sculptured
the façade of the ancient church of S. Cassiano, near Pisa,
the building of which was undoubtedly the work of the
Pisan Lodge. It is a round-arched church of the usual
large smooth square-cut blocks of stone, and is externally
adorned by pilasters with capitals of varied form and
sculpture. Biduinus' façade has five round arches with a
simple double-light window above. The capitals and
architraves are all carved with the mystic beasts and
hippogriffs belonging to the religion of the day. The
architraves show the resurrection of Lazarus, and Christ's
entry into Jerusalem. On one of the doors is the inscription
in Gothic letters&mdash;"<i>Hoc opus quod cernis. Biduinus docte
peregit</i>"; the other bears the date 1180. The whole style
of the church is similar to the Pistoja buildings of that
epoch, and recalls the school of Gruamonte. It is certain
that Biduinus as well as Gruamont worked in Lucca, for
the relief of the architrave of S. Salvatore at Lucca is
signed "<span class="s08">BIDUVINO ME FECIT HOC OPUS</span>."</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_223">See page 223.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The next great names are Niccolò and Giovanni Pisani,
the glory not only of their own lodge, but of the universal
Guild. Until the time when his famous pulpit was sculptured,
Niccolò seems to have worked little in Pisa, though he
endowed it with one of his most original designs&mdash;the bell-tower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
of S. Niccolò. From the evidence of southern
influence in his style, it is probable that his father Pietro
was one of the artists whom Frederic called to South Italy,
and that Niccolò passed his novitiate with him there. In
any case, by the time he wrote <i>Magister</i> before his name he
had already attained a high rank as sculptor and architect,
and was chosen for most important works out of Pisa,
such as the Arca di S. Domenico at Bologna, and the building
of the church and convent near it. Niccolò Pisano's work in
Florence was almost exclusively architectural; he also
designed the cathedral churches of Arezzo and Cortona.
His pupil, Fra Guglielmo, a relative of the Doge dell'
Agnello of Pisa who was Niccolò's assistant in the Arca
di S. Domenico at Bologna in 1272, worked in 1293 at
the reliefs in the façade of Orvieto, and in 1304 put
the Romanesque front to S. Michele in Borgo, in Pisa.
The Virgin and Child over the door of the latter is a copy
of Niccolò's famous statue. Some authors give him the
credit of being the <i>Tedesco</i> who Vasari says sculptured
the fine pulpit in S. Gio. Fuorcivitas at Pistoja, and who
assisted Bonanno in the tower of Pisa.</p>

<p>A sculptor named Bonaiuto must, I think, have
belonged to Niccolò's school. Two interesting sculptured
doorways by him still exist in what was once the Palazzo
Sclafani at Palermo (now the barracks of S. Trinità).
The doorway is carved in <i>tufo</i>, and above it is a kind of
gable supported by two small pilasters, enclosing the arms
of the family, a pair of cranes; surmounting the gable is
a carved eagle, with a hare in its claws, standing on a kind
of capital, which is unmistakably Comacine; beneath this
is a bracket inscribed, "<i>Bonaiuto me fe-cit de Pisa</i>." Sig.
Centofanti, in a private letter to Professor Clemente Lupi,
who wrote to ask for information about Bonaiuto, says that
a register of expenses of the Opera del Duomo of Pisa
contains several mentions of the name. In one dated 1315
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
<i>Bonaiutus magister lapidum</i> is noted as working at the
Duomo, and receiving two soldi a day, his companions
receiving four or five, and the <i>capo maestro</i> eight. Here it
would seem he is still in the lower ranks of the brotherhood.
In 1318 he is noted as Boniautus Michaelis, and receives
four soldi a day. In 1344 he has become full <i>capo maestro</i>
of the Duomo, and is paid nine soldi a day.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"  class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>From his school also sprang Arnolfo, the first of a long
line of sculptor-builders of the Florentine Lodge. From it,
too, through his son Giovanni, came the best builders of
the Siena cathedral, and their followers who worked at
Orvieto.</p>

<p>Thus Niccolò and Giovanni are proved to be links in
the old chain that came from classic Rome through the
Lombard Comacines to the Renaissance. All the famous
names that ever were, may be traced in this universal Guild
from father to son, from master to pupil. After Giovanni
Pisano went to Siena, Andrea di Pisa, his scholar, carried on
his school in Pisa. In 1299 we first hear of Andrea, the
son of a notary at Pontedera, as <i>famulus magistri Johannes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"  class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
His first authentic works were the bronze doors of the
Florentine Baptistery, proving that he had been trained in
the many-branched fraternity at Pisa, where metal-working
ranked so high. As instances of his sculptures in marble,
we may take many of the statues which were on the Duomo
at Florence, and the second line of reliefs on Giotto's
campanile. But like all the <i>Magistri</i>, he was, above all, an
architect, and in that branch we find him as Grand Master
at Orvieto in 1347. His son Nino succeeded him in the
onerous office. His other son Tommaso was also in the
guild, but did not rise to eminence in it. He designed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
palace, and painted two caskets for the Doge dell' Agnello
of Pisa.</p>

<p>Nino's sculptures show a greater fidelity to nature
than those of his artistic ancestors. A Madonna and two
angels over the door of the canonry of the Duomo at
Florence are very charming, as are his statues in the
church of the "Spina" at Pisa. We next find Nino's son
Andrea receiving payment for a sepulchre for the Doge
dell' Agnello, which Nino did not live long enough to finish.</p>

<p>One among Andrea's pupils who were not his relatives
rose to special and wide-spread eminence in the guild, <i>i.e.</i>
Magister Giovanni Balducci di Pisa, whose artistic career
was mostly in Milan, where the Visconti patronized him.
He sculptured several tombs, among them the beautiful
Arca of St. Peter Martyr in S. Eustorgio in 1336. The
figures of the Christian Virtues are very sweet and naturalistic.
On a sculptured pulpit at S. Casciano near Florence,
of the same shape and style as that by Guido di Como at
Pistoja, but infinitely more advanced in art, he has signed,
"Hoc opus fecit Johs Balducci Magister de Pisis." The
only architectural work that is mentioned as signed by him
is the door of S. Maria in Brera at Milan.</p>

<p>
The family were leading members of the guild up to the fifteenth
century, when Bartolommeo Buono and his sons won fame in Venice.</p>
</div>

<p>We have seen the long connection of the Comacines
with Lucca, during Lombard times, when they helped to
build S. Frediano and other churches there. Sig. Ridolfi,
author of <i>L' Arte in Lucca</i>, proves that not only the chief
churches, but the cathedral itself, were the work of the
Lombard "Maestri Casari" who had established their schools
there, since they restored S. Frediano for the Lombard
Faulone in 686, and built the Basilica of S. Martino for
Bishop Frediano in 588.</p>

<p>By the tenth century the church of S. Martino was
very dilapidated, which much grieved the mind of Bishop
Anselmo, who sought to gather together funds for its
restoration. Two wealthy Lucchesi, Lambertus and
Blancarius, both dignitaries of the cathedral, gave large
donations towards it. Not long after this, Bishop Anselmo
was elevated to the Papal See as Pope Alexander II., and
immediately began the long-desired work of rebuilding his
ex-cathedral.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_228">See page 228.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>He being a Milanese, and the Comacines his countrymen,
besides their having a long connection with Lucca,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
it is natural to suppose he chose them as his architects.
Every sign of the work confirms this, although no names
have come down to us. As was frequently the case, the
church was left without a façade for over a century, and at
the end of the twelfth century the Lucchesi wished to put
this finishing touch.</p>

<p>There was in Lucca at the time a certain Magister
Guido da Como, who had in 1187 built the church of S.
Maria Corteorlandini. It was built for the feudal Lords
Rolandinga, whose palace was called Corte Rolandinga,
on the occasion of one of their family joining in the
crusades.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176"  class="fnanchor">[176]</a> There is mention of a Comacine sculptor
named Guido before this date, at Corneto-Tarquinia,
where in the church of S. Maria di Castello is a fine
Ciborium, signed "Johannes et Guitto hoc opus fecerunt,
MCLXVIII." This, being only nineteen years previous,
may have been an earlier work of this same Guido. This
<i>Magister</i> evidently had a son who followed his father's art,
and was named after himself Guido, though called Guidetto,
or young Guido, to distinguish him from his father. To
these two men were confided the commission for the front
of the Duomo. Probably the elder did not live to
complete it, for although the commission was given to
Maestro Guido Marmolario (<i>sic</i>), the inscription on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
façade runs&mdash;"Mille C.C.|IIII.|condi|dit|ele|cti tam pul|
chras. dextra|Guidecti."<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177"  class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Among the sculptures is one
figure with a very young face, supposed to be a portrait of
Guidetto. This façade is a perfect specimen of pure
Comacine-Romanesque, and shows that the Saracen influence
under which the Masters had been placed in the
south, when employed by the Lombard Dukes of Beneventum,
had not led them to change entirely their old style,
but only to develop it into a species of Oriental richness
which (so far we may agree with old Vasari) sometimes
errs against truth and good taste. It shows also the close
connection between the Pisan and Lucchese Lodges.</p>

<p>The row of archlets which used to form a cornice under
the roof now, as at Pisa, run wild over the whole façade.
The outlines which used to follow honestly the shape of
nave and aisles, now, for the sake of heaping on more
ornament, stretch up far beyond the roof-line, forming a
mask.</p>

<p>A still more glaring instance of the same fault is seen
in Guidetto's other church, S. Michele, at Lucca, where
the two upper galleries are the frontage of a mere useless
wall in the air.</p>

<p>As an architect, young Guido left something to be
desired; as a sculptor he was marvellous. Variety seems
to have been his aim. In both S. Martino and S. Michele,
among all the hundreds of colonnettes, you can scarcely find
a duplicate. They are plain, fluted, foliaged, clustered,
inlaid; black, white, red, green, yellow or parti-coloured,
in endless variety. As for capitals, you get every
imaginable shape and style, symbol and ornamentation.
He outdoes his prototype Rainaldus of Pisa, and no clearer
proof of a guild, rather than a single mind, can be furnished,
than by this infinite variety of detail, which plainly speaks
of the imaginings of many minds.</p>

<p>The Comacines here are still in the transition stage,
though near its end, for the sign of the lion of Judah holds
its place above the pillar, under the spring of the arch. In
the Italian Gothic, their next development, it is always
beneath the column.</p>

<p>One of the lion-capped columns is entirely covered with
sculptures representing the genealogical tree of the Virgin.
The statue above the door, of St. Martin dividing his cloak
with the beggar, is sufficiently well modelled as to suggest
its belonging to a later century.</p>

<p>Signor Ridolfi, who has studied much in the archives of
Lucca for his learned work <i>L' Arte in Lucca</i>, thinks that,
in 1204, Guidetto the younger was only just beginning his
career. His father must have died about this time, for the
son loses his diminutive, and becomes in his turn Guido
<i>Magistro</i>. In 1211 he was called to Prato to work at the
Duomo there (then known as S. Stefano). The contract,
which still exists, does not specify what part of the church
he was to build. It is drawn up by the Notary Hildebrand,
and binds "Guido, Maestro marmoraio" of S.
Martino of Lucca, to go to Prato on fair terms, and there
to remain working, and <i>commanding others to work</i>, at the
church of S. Stefano. After this he was recalled to Lucca,
to put the above-mentioned façade to S. Michele, which
Teutprand had built in the eighth century, and which had
been rebuilt, when in 1027 Beraldo de' Rolandinghi had left
a large legacy for the purpose. This façade, which, as I have
said, is precisely similar in style to that of the Duomo,
was finished in 1246.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"  class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Guido was then called to Pisa, to
sculpture the altar and font in the Baptistery there. Not
much remains of the altar&mdash;which appears to have been
the usual edifice on four columns&mdash;except some very
ancient sculpture, and two small columns with extremely
rude statues on them. The inscription, however, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
preserved, and runs&mdash;"A.D. MCCXLVI, sub Jacobi
Rectore loci&mdash;Guido Bigarelli da Como fecit hoc opus."<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"  class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
This valuable discovery was made by the German
Schmarzow. Here we have the family name of this busy
sculptor, and of his father Guido of Como. It is one of
the first instances, for surnames only became fixed about
this time.</p>

<p>Guido or Guidetto's last work appears to have been
the pulpit in San Bartolommeo in Pantano, at Pistoja,
executed in 1250. This is particularly interesting, as
being the immediate precursor of Niccolò Pisano's pulpit
at Pisa in 1260. It has been thought that Guido, either
from death or other cause, left the work imperfect, and his
pupil Turrisianus finished it. The inscription as quoted by
Cav. Tolomei is&mdash;"Sculptor laudator qui doctus in arte
probatur|Guido de Como quem cunctis carmine promo|
Anno domini 1250|Est operi sanus superestans Turrisianus
|Namque fide prova vigil K Deus indi corona."<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"  class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Tolomei is puzzled by the cypher K, and Ciampi, the
collector of inscriptions, has, in reporting this one, left out
the last line altogether. He interprets it as implying that
Guido having left the work unfinished, Turrisianus finished
it. Whilst I was studying lately some old documents in
the archives of S. Jacopo at Pistoja, Signor Guido Macciò
of that city, who kindly assisted me to read the crabbed old
characters, threw a new light on that inscription. He says
Tolomei has misread it; that the cypher is not a K but
H C, which was plainly legible in a rubbing he took of it,
and that <i>superstans</i> merely means overseer; in fact, the
Latin form of <i>operaio</i>. The same term <i>superstans</i> was
used for the head of the <i>laborerium</i> in Rome up to the
fourteenth or fifteenth centuries, and survived in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
later lodges as <i>soprastante</i>. Signor Macciò interprets the
inscription thus&mdash;"The famous sculptor Guido of Como
has proved himself learned in art, and his name should
be sung in verse, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1250. Turrisianus (Torrigiani)
acted as overseer to this fine work, and may God crown
him for superintending the work so well." I leave more
learned classics to say which interpretation is the true one.
But as in most of the inscriptions, documents, etc. of the
guild, the name of the head of the lodge, and often those
of the councillors are put in, I incline to think Signor
Macciò may be right, and the inscription is another proof
of a Masonic lodge in which Torrigiani was, at the time, the
head of the administration.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_230">See page 230.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Guido's pulpit is of white marble, and in the ancient
square form, with eight panels in bas-relief. It rests on
three columns; the first stands on a lion with a dragon at
its feet, the second on a lioness suckling a cub, the third
on a human figure. In this pulpit, and the older one at
Groppoli, we have a perceptible link, connecting Niccolò
Pisano with the Comacine Guild, which we shall trace more
closely when speaking of Romanesque sculpture.</p>

<p>There were at that epoch three lodges in the immediate
neighbourhood. One in connection with the Opera del
Duomo at Pisa, one at Pistoja in the Opera di S. Jacopo, and
a third one at Lucca, where Guido and Guidetto were chief
sculptors. Besides this there was another in Apulia, where
it is thought Niccolò's father Pietro worked. Niccolò's
work, and that of Guido the younger, are so very much
alike as to warrant the suspicion that they were both pupils
of one master, but that Niccolò had in him these greater
qualities which go to form an epoch-making artist.</p>

<p>Little has hitherto come to light respecting the Masonic
lodges of Lucca and Pisa. The <i>laborerium</i> at Pistoja is
rather more clearly defined, and furnishes some definite
names. It existed from the twelfth century, but I do not

think the archives were kept quite so early as that. There
is the name <span class="smcap">Rodolfin's op</span>, anni 1167, carved on the
architrave of the principal entrance of the Lombard church
of S. Bartolommeo in Pantano; but as critics cannot tell
whether it means "Rodolfinus opus" or "Rodolfinus
operaius" or head of the Opera, it is not a very decisive bit
of history. The reading "Rodolfinus Operaius for the
year 1167" would, like "Turrisianus, overseer in 1250,"
be quite intelligible in its connection with the guild.</p>

<p>The façade of S. Bartolommeo is a masterpiece of
Lombard work. It has the usual three round-arched
doors, whose pilasters and architraves are rich with
interlaced scrolls and foliage, and whose richly-carved
arches rest on lions more or less fiercely dominating other
animals, as emblems that divine strength is able to overcome
sin. Whether all the animal sculptures on this
church are due to the twelfth-century builder, or whether
some are remains of Gundoaldo's<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"  class="fnanchor">[181]</a> first edifice in 767,
I cannot say. The architraves are certainly of the later
date.</p>

<p>The head, or <i>capo-maestro</i> of the <i>laborerium</i> of Pistoja
in the twelfth century, was evidently one of the Buono
family, whose race and school became as famous as the
Antelami and Campionesi, all three being branches of the
original Lombard Guild. Like the Antelami and the
Campionesi, the school founded by the Buoni furnished
several shining lights among the Lombard <i>Magistri</i>. The
name is first met with in the poem of which we have
spoken,<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182"  class="fnanchor">[182]</a> on the Ten Years' War between Milan and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
people of Como. Among the brave citizens who threw
down their tools to take arms, and distinguished themselves
in wielding them, was a certain Giovanni Buono from
Vesonzo (now Bissone) in Vall' Intelvi, who took part in
the siege of the fortress of S. Martino on Lake Lugano.
The war took place in the tenth century; the poem was
written a little later than 1100. Sig. Merzario<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"  class="fnanchor">[183]</a> opines
that the Maestro Buono of whom Vasari speaks as the
"first architect who showed a more elevated spirit, and
aimed after better things, but of whose country and family
he knows nothing,"<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184"  class="fnanchor">[184]</a> was one of this line of sculptor-architects
originally from Vesonzo (Bissone) in Inteluum (Val
d'Intelvi). The name Giovanni occurs constantly in the
lists.</p>

<p>Certainly the head of the line, as far as regards art,
was the Magister Giovanni Buoni here mentioned by
Vasari, who goes on to say that this Buono in 1152 had
been employed on buildings in Ravenna, after which he
was called to Naples, where he built the Castel dell' Uovo
and Castel Capuano; and that in the time of Doge
Domenico Morosini, <i>i.e.</i> 1154, he founded the Campanile
of S. Marco at Venice, which Vasari asserts was so well
built that up to his time it had never moved a hair (<i>non ha
mai mosso un pelo</i>).</p>

<p>Vasari says that Giovanni Buono was in 1166 at Pistoja,
where he built the church of S. Andrea. Both Milanesi,
Vasari's annotator, and Merzario<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185"  class="fnanchor">[185]</a> complain that Vasari
was very confused in these statements. The tower of S.
Marco was, Cicognara says, by a later Bartolommeo Buono
from Bergamo, who also built the Procuratie Vecchie in the
sixteenth century. It is curious how Vasari, living in the
same century, could have made such a statement; he must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
have known whether the tower were being built then, or
had been standing for several centuries. The fact was
that one Buono built the older tower in Venice to which
Vasari refers, and the sixteenth-century Bartolommeo
Buono was its restorer. The style is certainly antique.</p>

<p>Vasari's annotators agree that this Buono worked at
Arezzo, where he built the bell-tower, and the ancient
palace of the Signoria of Arezzo (<i>cio è un palazzo della
maniera de' Goti</i>), <i>i.e.</i> with large hewn stones; after which
he came to Pistoja, where he built S. Andrea and other
churches.</p>

<p>But even here some confusion exists. It is difficult
to decide whether the builder of S. Andrea at Pistoja,
and the cathedral of Lucca was indeed named Buono
or Gruamonte. There is an inscription on the sculpture
of the architrave of the façade which has been a
great bone of contention. It proves, however, beyond
a doubt that the usual organization, with the <i>Opera</i> as
the administrative branch, existed in Pistoja in 1196. It
runs&mdash;"Fecit hoc opus Gruamons magister bon(us) et
Adot ... (Adeodatus) frater ejus. Tunc era&#772;t operarii Villanus
et Pathus filius Tignosi <span class="s08">A.D.</span> MCIXVI."<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186"  class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This work
was done by Gruamons, Master Buono, and Adeodatus his
brother; Villanus and Pathus, son of Tignosi, being then
<i>operai</i> (<i>i.e.</i> on the administrative council).</p>

<p>In that word <i>bonus</i> lies the difficulty. Some say it is
merely placed in encomium: Gruamons the good master;
but it does not seem to me probable that a man would
habitually sign his name with a boastful adjective; and
habitual it was, because on the white stripes of the architrave
of the church of S. Giovanni Evangelista Fuorcivitas
he has again signed himself "Gruamons magister bonus
fêc hoc opus." Knowing the Italian love of nicknames
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
from the earliest ages, I take it that the architect was
really, as Vasari says, Master Bonus or Buono, and that
either from a long neck and a stoop, or from his clever
use of a crane, he was nicknamed Gruamons, "the crane
man,"<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187"  class="fnanchor">[187]</a> <i>grue</i> being Italian for both bird and machine.
That the Gruamons who carved the Magi on the architrave
of S. Andrea was one of the very early Masters, is
evident from the mediæval grossness of his work in carving
the human figure; that he may very likely be Comacine
is suggested by the style and mastery of his <i>ornamento</i> and
the life in the figures of his animals. The capitals supporting
this architrave are evidently by one of his subordinates;
they are very rough, but full of meaning, explaining the
mystery of the Annunciation and Conception; below them
the signature <i>Magister enricus mi fecit</i>. These early
sculptures are especially interesting, for they are the first
efforts of the Comacines to show Bible events and truths
by actual representation instead of by symbols, and so form
the link with the development under Niccolò Pisano.
Hence the greater want of practice in the human figures,
compared to the animals and scrolls, with which the guild
had been familiar for ages.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_327" id="i_327"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Church of S. Andrea, Pistoja. Designed by Gruamons.</span></p>
<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_235">See page 235.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to compare Gruamons' work with that
of the later sculptor of the façade of S. Bartolommeo, and
note the rapid progress that art was making towards more
perfect and natural form in sculpture. There are only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
twenty-two years between them, but the sculptor of S.
Bartolommeo is far in advance of Gruamons in his representation
of the human figure. It is said that Gruamons
has left his sign in a portrait of himself on the doorway
of S. Andrea, where a curiously negro-like head stands
out from the middle of a column. It seems, however, to
have acquired its blackness by being used through several
centuries as a torch extinguisher at funerals.</p>

<p>Another of Gruamons' churches in Pistoja is that of S.
Giovanni Evangelista Fuorcivitas, which is extremely
interesting as showing a perfect specimen of the practicable
Lombard gallery or outer ambulatory, which in two orders
here surrounds the church. The building is entirely encrusted
with black and white marble, mostly in alternate lines, but
in some places inlaid in chequers. This fashion, which
began in this very city of Pistoja, has an historical significance,
and was introduced as a symbol of the peace between
the factions of Bianchi and Neri, which so long harassed
Pistoja. It was taken up afterwards by Siena and Orvieto,
and in Florence and Prato, when their respective civic
feuds were healed.</p>

<p>Gruamons, or Magister Buono, may have been the chief
master of the <i>laborerium</i> at Pistoja with its accompanying
<i>Opera di S. Jacopo</i>, which began to keep its registers in
1145. At any rate his family name was kept up in that
lodge for more than a century. The Buoni followed the
usual custom, and sought commissions in other towns. In
1206 we find one of them restoring and almost rebuilding
the cathedral at Fiesole, which had been built in 1028, in
the time of Bishop Jacopo Bavaro, but was menacing ruin
two centuries later. On the sixth column of the nave, on
the right, is inscribed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"MCCVI. Indict VIII Bonus Magister Restaurus.</p>
<p>Operarius Ecclesiæ Fesulanæ Fecit Ædificare</p>
<p>IIII columnas I. Allex P.P."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>Here even at this early date we have the <i>Opera</i> or
administration under the direction of the dignitaries of the
cathedral. The tower was built by a Maestro Michele in
1213. An inscription on the left of the apse tells us that
the building of the tower cost seventy <i>mancussi</i>, a gold
coin in use in the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188"  class="fnanchor">[188]</a> It is supposed that
Maestro Buono copied his church from S. Miniato near
Florence. The plan is nearly identical, and both have the
same peculiarity of the omission of the narthex, or portico,
which till this time had been an indispensable part of the
ecclesiastic Basilica. It is true the Fiesole church is built
of stone, and is simple in ornament, while S. Miniato is
of marble and rich in decorations, but in plan and form
the two are identical. In each case the same use has
been made of the older buildings on the site by leaving
them as crypts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_331" id="i_331"></a>
<img src="images/i_331.jpg" width="447" height="361" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Church of San Giovanni Fuorcivitas, Pistoja. Designed by Gruamons.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_236">See page 236.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The first San Miniato church was built under Charlemagne,
by Bishop Hildebrand in 774; the second was
endowed by the Emperor Henry the Saint, and Saint
Cunegonda his wife; both times the patrons were accustomed
to employ the Comacine Masters. In San Miniato
we see one of their masterpieces.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century another distinguished scion
of the Buono race came down to join the lodge at Pistoja.
We have seen Giovanni Buono, or Zambono as he writes
himself, at work at S. Antonio at Padua in 1264, together
with Egidio, son of Magister Graci; Nicola, son of Giovanni;
Ubertino, son of Lanfranco, etc. In 1265 Magister
Bonus or Buono was <i>capo-maestro</i> and architect of the
Duomo at Pistoja, and in 1266 he erected the tribune of
S. Maria Nuova there, on the cornice of which he has
carved&mdash;"<span class="s08">A.D.</span> MCCLXVI tempore Parisii Pagni<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189"  class="fnanchor">[189]</a> et
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Simones, Magister Bonus fecit hoc opus," <i>i.e.</i> <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1266,
in the time when Paris Pagni and Simones were <i>operai</i>,
Magister Bonus executed this work.</p>

<p>In 1270 Buono was commissioned to make the façade
of the church of S. Salvatore in the same energetic little
town. The inscription on the pretty little façade is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Anno milleno bis centum septuageno</p>
<p>Hoc perfecit opus qui fertur nomine Bonus</p>
<p>Præstabant operi Jacobus, Scorcione vocatus</p>
<p>Et Benvenuti Joannes, quos Deus omnes</p>
<p>Salvator lenis millis velit augere penis. Amen."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here we get the names of two <i>operai</i> instead of one.
It is evident that the lodge has increased since Gruamons
was head of the <i>laborerium</i>, and Turrisianus head of the
<i>Opera</i>. According to custom, one was an eminent Pistojese,
and the other a <i>Magister</i>. We find Johannes Benvenuti
working with Giovanni in several other cities.</p>

<p>The question we have now to answer is whether this
Giovanni Buono, who was in Pistoja from 1265 to 1270,
was the same man who worked at Padua in 1264, and was
afterwards head of the lodge at Parma in 1280? An indication,
if not a lateral proof, is found in studying who were
his companions. At Pistoja in 1264, Nicola, son of Giovanni,
was his assistant, and in 1270 Johannes Benvenuti
was with him. At Parma in 1280 we find that Guido,
Nicola, Bernardino, and Benvenuto were in the <i>laborerium</i>
when he was chief architect. Here we have at least two
of his companions, not including Guido, with him in the
works of all three cities, which would go far to prove his
identity.</p>

<p>The Buono family form a curious connection between
Corneto Tarquinia and Pistoja. We have already spoken
of the Ciborium at Corneto, sculptured by Johannes and
Guitto (Guido) in 1168. The pulpit in the same church,
and another at Alba Fucense, are both signed by Giovanni
Buono and Andrea his brother, but date a century later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
than the Ciborium, <i>i.e.</i> precisely the time of our Giovanni
Buono of Pistoja. The façade of the same church at
Corneto Tarquinia is full of Comacine sculptures; and on
the double-arched windows with the tesselated columns is
an epigraph saying that the "inlaid work in porphyry, serpentine,
and <i>giallo antico</i>" was done by Nicolao, son of
Ranuccio. Now this must have been the Nicolao who
worked under this same Giovanni Buono in 1280 at Parma,
with a certain Guido and Johannes Benvenuti. Guido was
evidently a kinsman of Giovanni Buono, for we find that
in 1285 Albertus, son of Guido Buono, and Albertinus, son
of Enrico Buono, were employed together in the sculptures
at S. Pietro at Bologna.</p>

<p>In any case we have a long connection of the Buono
family with the Opera di S. Jacopo at Pistoja, and shall
find them still engaged in other important works at Pisa
and Lucca, besides being chief architects at Parma and
Padua, etc. Two centuries later their descendants were
building fine Gothic works in Venice.</p>

<p>The Baptistery of Pistoja has been attributed to Andrea
Pisano, but a document in the archives of the Opera di
S. Jacopo not only shows who was the real architect, or
rather head-master, but proves that it was done by a
Magister Cellini of the Masonic Guild from the lodge at
Siena, who became Grand Master of the lodge at Pistoja.
It runs&mdash;"Et per Magistrum Cellinum qui est caput
magistrorum edificantium Ecclesiam rotundam S. Joannis
Baptistæ."<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190"  class="fnanchor">[190]</a> There also exists in the archives the contract
made between the <i>Opera</i> (administrative council) and
Magister Cellini on July 22, 1339, for the completion and
ornamentation of the building which he had so far constructed.
There is no mention of Andrea Pisano in either
deed.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>The Pistojan Baptistery is not a very pleasing building.
There is something inharmonious in its proportions. It is
of the usual octagonal form, but too high for its width; the
horizontal lines of white and black marble still further
detract from its beauty, and cut up the ornamentation.</p>

<p>On the whole the architect who wants to study Comacine
churches cannot do so better than at Pistoja, where
there is so much of the old work left. Besides the edifices
we have already mentioned, are other two very interesting
churches, S. Piero Maggiore and S. Paolo, although nothing
but the outer shell of either is now remaining.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"  class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The architrave
of S. Piero Maggiore has a very mediæval relief on
it, representing Christ giving a huge key to St. Peter, while
the Apostles and the Virgin stand in a row beside them.
The capital of one pilaster has a man-faced lion, whose
tail forms an interlaced knot. The other has upstanding
volutes of a heavy kind of foliage. Lions lie beneath the
spring of the arch, and winged griffins and other mystic
animals are on brackets along the façade. I think the
capitals and mystic beasts must have belonged to the first
Longobardic church built by Ratpert, son of Guinichisius,
in 748, as well as the lower part of the façade, which is
certainly of the most ancient <i>opus gallicum</i>, of large smooth
stones closely fitted. The architrave and the upper part,
which consists of an arcade patched on in white and black
marble, belong to Giovanni Buono's restoration in 1263.
In old times a curious ceremony used to take place in this
church, which belonged to the Convent of Benedictine
nuns. When a new bishop took possession of the see, he
was espoused (spiritually of course) to the abbess of this
Order, with solemn rites and ceremonies.</p>

<p>S. Paolo was a priory church. This, too, had been built
in 748 by the first Comacines under the Longobards, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
evidences still remain that it was originally turned from
east to west, the façade being then where the choir is now.
It was rebuilt when S. Atto was bishop of the city in 1133,
and besides a very pretty frontal, has a good specimen of
the upper external gallery surrounding the church.</p>

<p>I will end my chapter on Pistoja with a mention of an
interesting old MS. from the archives of the Opera di
S. Jacopo, which, with Signor Macciò's aid, we found to be
the marriage contract of a certain Maestro Jacopo Lapi.
The bridegroom is named as Jacobus Dominus Lapus, fili
Turdi, di Inghilberti, who wishes to contract marriage
with Marchesana filia Sannutini, and to "live with her
according to Longobardic law." The deed then goes on to
specify the lands and possessions he bestows on his bride
as a <i>morgincap</i>. This might be interesting in art history,
if it could be proved whether the Jacopo Lapi were that
pupil of Niccolò Pisano's who worked with him and Arnolfo
at Siena in 1266.</p>

<p>In that case it gives the Jacopo Lapi's family an added
interest as of Longobardic origin through his grandfather,
Inghilbert. We further learn by the document that his
great-grandmother's name was Molto-cara (very dear).
This, taken together with the name Tordo (thrush) given
to her son, proves how the nickname outweighed the family
or baptismal name in mediæval times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC ORNAMENTATION</h3>

<p>When the romantic style of building, which the Comacine
Masters had imbibed in Sicily, came in, their serious
set-by-rule building went out. The first use they made of
their new ideas was to increase the richness of decoration,
and this they did by the almost childish expedient of multiplying
their old ornaments. Instead of one little pillared
gallery on the top of a façade, they now put whole rows of
galleries, or covered the fronts all over with them, as in
Lucca, Pisa, and Arezzo. There is a very early instance
of this in the church of Santa Maria at Ancona, of which
we give an illustration. Here the network of arches are
not real galleries, but only sculpturesque simulations; each
arch is simply placed on the top of the other, without architrave
or frieze. The doorway has the usual Comacine
interlaced knots and no lions, so the façade may stand as
an early sample of the transition into Romanesque, dating
about the eleventh century.</p>

<p>The style shows a much further advance in Magister
Marchionni's façade to the church of Santa Maria della
Pieve at Arezzo, which is a fine sample of Romanesque.
It was done in 1216. The façade has four rows of arches,
one on the other, "growing small by degrees and beautifully
less" as they ascend. Of all the hundred columns
which support them, no two are alike. They are round,
square, octagonal, sexagonal, pentagonal, multi-angular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
fluted, twisted, grotesque, crooked, Byzantine, Corinthian,
Ionic, Doric, Gothic, Egyptian, Babylonian, caryatid, black,
green, white, striped, or inlaid. Some have single bases,
a round on a square, or <i>vice versâ</i>, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.
Yet with all this variety there is a certain unity of design,
which bespeaks a multitude of Masters, each one using his
own fancy in his particular part of the work, but one chief
to whose general design the masters of the parts are subservient.
Ruskin realized the beauty of this variety of idea,
though he had not perceived that it came from a multitude
of minds working together, when he said&mdash;"The more conspicuous
the irregularities are, the greater the chance of its
being a good style." And again&mdash;"The traceries, capitals,
and other ornaments must be of perpetually varied designs."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_339" id="i_339"></a>
<img src="images/i_339.jpg" width="494" height="383" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Church of S. Maria, Ancona.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_242">See page 242.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The very same style and variety, showing a multiplex
manufacture, is displayed by the cathedral, and the church
of San Michele at Lucca, and the old church of San Michele
in Borgo at Pisa. The two Lucca ones are extremely
enriched by friezes of the symbolic animals above each row
of arches. The cathedral and tower of Pisa show greater
unity of conception.</p>

<p>The next great change was, that after the eleventh
century, the interlaced work, or Solomon's knot, was no
longer the secret sign of the Comacine work. They probably
found that there was a limit even to the combinations
of the interlaced line, or that it did not give enough relief.
Certain it is, that on the rise of Romanesque architecture,
the <i>intreccio</i> faded away into mere mouldings, or got
changed into foliaged scrolls for architraves; but the mystic
knot with neither beginning nor end was no more used
with special significance. The rounded sculpture of figures
was everywhere replacing low relief, and the Comacine
sign and seal of this epoch, was the Lion of Judah. From
this time forward for the 400 years that Romanesque and
Gothic architecture lasted, there is, I believe, scarcely a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
church built by the great Masonic Guild in which the Lion
of Judah was not prominent.</p>

<p>My own observations have led me to the opinion that in
Romanesque or Transition architecture, <i>i.e.</i> between <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
1000 and 1200, the lion is to be found between the columns
and the arch&mdash;the arch resting upon it. In Italian Gothic,
<i>i.e.</i> from <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1200 to 1500, it is placed beneath the column.
In either position its significance is evident. In the first,
it points to Christ as the door of the Church. In the second,
to Christ the pillar of faith springing from the tribe of Judah.
Thus at Lucca, Pisa, and Arezzo, where the guild worked
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the lion is always
above the column. In Verona, Como, Modena, and where
Italian Gothic porches were added in the thirteenth century,
and in Florence, Siena, Orvieto, where the cathedrals date
from the fourteenth century, you find the lion beneath the
column. And in minor works of sculpture there is the
same difference. In the pulpit of Sant' Ambrogio at Milan,
the lions are beneath the spring of the arches; in the pulpits
of Niccolò Pisano at Siena and Guido di Como (thirteenth
century) at Pistoja, they are beneath the column.</p>

<p>A most beautiful instance of the transition between
Lombard and Romanesque is in the door of the church of
San Giusto at Lucca, dating from the twelfth century. The
architrave is a grand <i>intreccio</i> of oak branches while the
pilasters, which form the door-jambs, have richly-carved
capitals of mixed acanthus leaves and Ionic volutes, with a
mystic beast clinging to each. The arch superimposed on
the architrave has a rich scroll of cherubs and foliage,
and it rests on two huge lions. It is altogether a perfect
Comacine design.</p>

<p>The next change in the sculpture of the Comacine
Masters was the humanization of their sculpture. The rude
old carvings of symbolical beasts no longer satisfied them.
Christianity had now endured a thousand years and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
understood, so that it was no longer needful to use parables
and mystic signs. They still made the fronts of their
churches Bibles in stone, as they had done before; only the
Bible was in a language all could read, <i>i.e.</i> the sculptured
story. From Adam and Eve to Christ and the Virgin, and
even the least of the Saints, the Comacine put all Scripture
upon his church. His Bible lay open that all might read.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_343" id="i_343"></a>
<img src="images/i_343.jpg" width="378" height="572" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Door of S. Giusto at Lucca, 12th century.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_244">See page 244.</a></i></p>
</div>
<p>The representation of the human figure was at first
heavy and disproportionate, but as the centuries passed on,
it grew in grace; and sculptors were able to express their
conceptions more completely. The animal symbolism did
not, however, entirely disappear. It is seen in every quaint
fancy of the Gothic artist of the north, in every naïve bit of
church ornamentation in the south; but it is no longer the
object and end of design. It had become subservient; the
human figure now took the first place.</p>

<p>In the earlier transition stage, even this actual representation
was more or less allegorical. As an interesting
instance of the allegorical nature of Comacine sculpture, we
may take the relief of the Crucifixion in the cathedral at
Parma (third chapel on the right), carved by Benedetto da
Antelamo in 1178. In this almost mediæval relief, the
artist has managed to put a symbolical history of the greatest
events of his own times&mdash;the defeat of Barbarossa, the fall
of Victor Antipope, the triumph of Pope Alexander III., the
cessation of schism, and the gleams of coming peace on
Italy. Around the cross where Christ hangs, he represents
the Church as a symbolic personage waving the flag of
victory; and the schismatic enemy with his banner broken.
Every figure in the composition has its meaning, and the
whole displays a thinking mind, even though the hand be
still a little heavy and mediæval. That this is a veritable
Comacine work the sculptor himself has chronicled. On
the top of the relief is written in the Lombard Gothic
characters&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Anno milleno centeno septuageno</p>
<p>Octavo scultor patravit M&#864;se secundo</p>
<p>Antelami dictus scultor fuit, hic Benedictus."</p>
</div></div>

<p>An old chronicler of the sixteenth century tells us that
this relief once ornamented an ambone or pulpit supported
on four columns, which was destroyed in 1566.</p>

<p>Another very interesting work is the font for immersion
in S. Frediano at Lucca, sculptured by Maestro Roberto in
the twelfth century. The figures which surround it are as
usual full of meaning but grotesque in proportion; though
one can see in the draperies a foreshadowing of that return
to classicality which Niccolò Pisano afterwards advanced
towards perfection. We have here a queer representation
of Adam and Eve, both clad in classical garments and standing
by a conventional fig tree, out of which looks the head
of the Eternal Father in a cloud like a medallion. Eve is
clutching the tail of a monstrous serpent. In the next compartment
the four Evangelists carry their emblems on their
shoulders. St. Mark, with his lion, sits in a curule chair, and
looks like a Roman Prefect, mediævalized. St. John has his
eagle standing on a Roman altar beside him, while St.
Matthew carries the child on his shoulder like a St. Christopher.
As the work of a forerunner of Niccolò Pisano in the
same brotherhood, the font is intensely interesting.</p>

<p>The cathedral at Beneventum (one of the Lombard
dukedoms) has some beautiful Comacine arabesques on the
pilasters of the great door. We give an illustration from
one of them. The interlaced maze is formed by a conventional
vine, in the branches of which are symbolical animals.
Here is the Lamb of God, signed as divine and eternal by
numberless circles all over it. The eagle, symbol of faith, is
strangling sin in the form of a serpent; above, is a calf,
emblem of the Christian, overcoming evil in the form of
a bird of prey. In meaning, the intention is the same as
the old sculptures on San Michele, executed six centuries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
previously; but speaking technically, sculpture as an art has
advanced greatly. There is rich and clear relief, and
intelligibility of design in this work.</p>

</div>

<p>Symonds,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"  class="fnanchor">[192]</a> speaking of this stage of art, says&mdash;"The
so-called Romanesque and Byzantine styles were but the
dotage of second childhood (it was a childhood which grew
and developed into virility, however), fumbling with the
methods and materials of an irrevocable past. It is true
indeed that unknown mediæval carvers had shown an
instinct for the beautiful, as well as great fertility of grotesque
invention. The façades of Lombard churches are covered
with fanciful and sometimes forcibly dramatic groups of
animals and men in contest; and contemporaneously with
Niccolò Pisano, many Gothic sculptors of the north were
adorning the façades and porches of cathedrals with statuary
unrivalled in one style of loveliness. Yet the founder of a
line of progressive artists had not arisen, and except in
Italy the conditions were still wanting under which alone the
plastic arts could attain independence." Here Symonds
goes on to speak of Niccolò Pisano, as the fountain-head
of sculpture.</p>

<p>And now we can no longer evade the knotty question
of who and what Niccolò was, where did he arise from, and
where was he trained in art?</p>

<p>There are always those conflicting documents which
Milanesi found to be reconciled. The first, in the archives
of the Opera di S. Jacopo at Pistoja, dated July 11, 1272,
which runs&mdash;<i>Magister Nichola pisanus, filius Petri de</i>&mdash;(here
is an illegible word which Ciampi reads as <i>Senis</i><a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193"  class="fnanchor">[193]</a>).
He chose this reading because another document dated
November 13, 1272, styles "Niccolò" Magister Nichola,
quondam Petri de (Senis) Ser Blasii pisa ... (<i>hiatus</i>).</p>

<p>Milanesi, however, who found at Siena the contract for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Niccolò's pulpit there, dated October 5, 1266, says the word
<i>Senis</i> should be read <i>Sancti</i>, for in the Sienese contract the
words are plainly&mdash;<i>Magister Niccolus de parroccia ecclesie
sancti Blasii de ponte de Pisis, etc. etc.</i> In another document
also at Siena, in which Niccolò is commanded to send for his
pupil Arnolfo to work with him, we get <i>Magistrum Nicholam
de Apulia</i>. In two others of the next year, <i>Magister
Niccholus olim Petri lapidum de Pisis</i>. Now all this is very
puzzling, and yet being documentary it must all be true.
We will put Siena entirely out of the question, the word
proving to be a misreading of <i>Sancti</i>, so that instead of the
second document meaning Niccolò son of the late Peter son
of Ser Blasius or Biagio of Siena, it must read Niccolò son
of Peter of the parish of St. Blasius at Pisa. We have then
the two different nationalities of his father Pietro&mdash;Pisa
and Apulia&mdash;to account for. Milanesi suggests that Apulia
means a little place near Lucca called Puglia.</p>

<p>The further light we have found thrown on the peregrinations
of <i>Magistri</i> of the guild may assist us to reconcile
the conflicting statements. It is certain, as we said before,
that Niccolò Pisano was a <i>Magister</i> of the guild, and
being a man of genius he became one of its most important
members. His membership was moreover hereditary; his
father had been also a <i>Magister lapidum</i>. Now the Comacines
had a lodge in Apulia, from the time of the Longobards,
and traces of it still remained after 1100, in a small
colony in the valley of Æterno, which preserved as a kind
of monopoly the art of building.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194"  class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The church of S. Sofia at Beneventum, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 788, and the
monastery of S. Pietro were built by them, as well as the later
cathedrals of Trani, Bari, and Ruvo. The latter still retains
its ancient Lombard façade covered with figures of animals,
the portal being flanked by columns surmounted by a fine
rose window. When the Normans succeeded the Longobards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and Saracens in Apulia, the Masonic Guild was still
more busy there, and it was very probable that Pietro the
sculptor worked in Apulia under the Norman dynasty, with
many of his brethren. I am told that there is in Bari
cathedral a pulpit of the same form as that by Niccolò, but
of an earlier date. This is a significant proof of Niccolò's
early training in Apulia, probably under his own father, as
was the custom of the guild. It would also account for the
Saracenic touch in his arches and ornamentation. The lions
under the columns were used by the Masonic Guild a
century before Niccolò's time, so it is evident they were not,
as Ruskin and others suppose, borrowed from the Saracens
by Niccolò. There is a most interesting pulpit of the older
square form at Groppoli near Pistoja, dated 1194, with lions
beneath the pillars. It offers one of the very early specimens
of the sculptured scriptural story. The panels represent the
"Nativity of Christ" and the "Flight into Egypt," both most
naïvely designed. The square pulpit of Guido da Como in
S. Bartolommeo at Pistoja is dated <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1250, and shows the
immense improvement art had made in those sixty years.
In some ways Guido da Como quite equals Niccolò. He
does not strain after the classic, but there is great and simple
dignity, and even grace in his figures, some of which are
almost worthy of Fra Angelico. It was ten years after
Guido's lion-pillared pulpit was finished, that we find Niccolò&mdash;who
had for some years been working at Pisa, where he
was then domiciled&mdash;sculpturing his famous pulpit there, and
though altering the form from square to octagon, using the
same symbolism, and in many ways the same treatment of
his subject, as Guido had done before him. It would be a
suggestive proof of the same influence in training, to compare
the panels representing the Nativity, in the three pulpits.
The Lombard one at Groppoli, Guido da Como's at Pistoja,
and Niccolò's at Pisa, and one might add a fourth, <i>i.e.</i>
Giovanni Pisano's pulpit in S. Andrea at Pistoja, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
is in some respects an advance on his father's design,
although it is evidently not only inspired, but almost copied
from it. There are in all four, the same kind of <i>lectis</i>
for bed, the same cows, out of perspective, high up in the
background, and in the two last the same treatment of
drapery. In some ways, however, Niccolò has passed far
beyond Guido. While Guido followed his forefathers'
traditions, Niccolò had been first revelling in the richness
of Saracenic types in Apulia, and then living among the
classic spoils of Pisa, where Diotisalvi had worked before
him.</p>

<p>His school at Pisa inaugurated a revival which was to
change art for all the world. Yet it was only a step and
not a sudden leap. He was no ancestorless genius springing
from darkness and chaos, but a link in the chain of art
from which in him a new strand departed, leading towards
Donatello and Ghiberti. He took the forms of his sect,
but improved and freed them; he held to the traditional
symbolism of his guild, but classicized and enriched it.
His greatest advance was in the modelling of the human
figure, and here his classic models helped him. One
suspects that he depended much on those models, for
where he had no antique to copy from, he degenerated
into the mediævalism of his fraternity. The mixture of
the two styles is very apparent in the different panels of
his pulpit, some of which look as if they had come from
Antonine's column, while others are heavier and less graceful
by far than Guido da Como's simple natural figures. The
fact was, that in his time the whole guild was developing
under the freer conditions of art, and Niccolò was one of
its leading masters, and endowed with especial talent.</p>

<p>With him the Romanesque period closes, and the Italian
Gothic begins. Led by him the Comacines in Tuscany
left the rude, distorted images and meaningless monsters
behind, and marched on towards the perfection of sculpture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of the human form as shown by Donatello and Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_250">See page 250.</a></i></p>

<p>Among the Comacines in Lombardy the same change
was in progress. Jacopo Porrata, working at nearly the
same time, carved the life-like prophets and bas-relief on
the façade of the cathedral of Cremona, which bears the
legend, "Magister Jacobus Porrata de Cumis fecit hanc
rotam MCCLXXIIII."</p>

<p>Antonio de Frix of Como, working in concert with Meo
di Checco, carved the beautiful roof of the Duomo at Ferrara,
while other Masters were sculpturing sacred stories on
pulpits and doorways, vestibules and decorations in many
a church which their forerunners had built.</p>

<p>With the development of the Gothic, the guild again
changed the style of their ornamentation.</p>

<p>The pointed gable over the circular arch was one
of the first signs of this change. You see it in Siena,
Orvieto, Florence, and the fourteenth-century porches in
Lombardy.</p>

<p>The gable gave an opening for statuary, floriated
crockets, and ornate pinnacles; the pointed arch opened a
way to beautiful tracery; the upward shaft and pilaster
afforded space for the ornate tabernacle or saint-filled niche;
for the sculptor-architect never let an inch go plain which
could be effectively sculptured.</p>

<p>Between the solid Lombard round arch and the pointed
traceried one stands the cusping of the circular arch. Ruskin
credits Niccolò Pisano also with this; saying grandiloquently
that "in the five cusped arches of Niccolò's pulpit you see
the first Gothic Christian architecture ... the change, in
a word, for all Europe, from the Parthenon to Amiens
cathedral. For Italy it means the rise of her Gothic
dynasty&mdash;it means the Duomo of Milan instead of the
Temple of Paestum."<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195"  class="fnanchor">[195]</a> This is very poetic, but it will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
bear analysis. The cusps of Niccolò's arches were by no
means the first to be seen in Italy; we find them in several
churches of the twelfth century; and as for Amiens cathedral,
that was nearly completed when Niccolò's pulpit was
carved.</p>

<p>The cusping of the round arch came up from the south;
it was suggested to the Comacines by the Saracenic architecture,
as a variety on their usual twin archlets under a
round arch, and was used some time before they adopted
the pointed arch.</p>

<p>The first real Italian step to the pointed Gothic began
at Assisi, in the hands of Jacopo il Tedesco, and his fellow-countryman,
Fra Filippo di Campello, or Campiglione.
Jacopo stands to Italian Gothic architecture in the same
place as Niccolò Pisano stands to Renaissance sculpture.
In Italy, the land of classic Rome, true Gothic never
developed in the form in which we see it further north.
Her finest buildings retained in parts the older forms, and
with the humanism of the classic revival of literature, a
classic revival of architecture also took place. The
Gothic style in Italy was strangled in its infancy by
Bramante and Michael Angelo. Even Milan, though a
glorious Gothic building, was masked and disfigured by
a Renaissance front, with its straight lines and geometric
pediments.</p>

<p>The Germans and French, taking the germ from Italy,
developed it magnificently; and it is fortunate that they
had broken the bonds of the old Masonic brotherhood, and
nationalized themselves and their art in time to keep their
Gothic forms pure.</p>

<p>If we should attempt to particularize examples of Italian
Gothic ornamentation, volumes would not be enough. We
will be content with a few instances of sculpture by the
Lombard guild at this epoch.</p>

</div>

<p>Some beautiful illustrations of their allegorical style are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
to be seen in studying the capitals of the colonnade of the
Ducal Palace at Venice, some of which were by Bartolommeo
Buono, son of the fifteenth-century Zambono or Giovanni
Buono. We give an illustration of one with allegorical
representations of the classical goddesses, Venus, Minerva,
and Juno, throned in acanthus leaves. Minerva looks like
a mediæval school-mistress as she teaches Hebe and the
Loves, from a ponderous tome. The famous Adam and
Eve capital, of which Ruskin writes so eloquently, was
probably by the same hand. Bartolommeo's best carving
was in his "Porta della Carta," the door of the Grand Ducal
Palace, next San Marco, which is rich in the extreme, and
is signed on the architrave "Opus Bartolommei."</p>

<p>Bartolommeo's father, Giovanni Buono, was the head
architect of the beautiful "Ca' d'oro," and here the richness
of decorative sculpture under florid Gothic forms reaches its
height.</p>

<p>The family Buono came from Campione, and I think it
probable that this was the same Bartolommeo da Campione
whose name is on several of the Gothic capitals of
Milan cathedral. We give an illustration of one of them,
which is extremely rich in statues and pinnacles.</p>

<p>The rapid march from the early pointed towards florid
Gothic sculpture, is evidenced in a remarkable manner by
the tombs of the Scaligers in Verona. The monument to
Mastino II., who died in 1351, by Magister Porino or
Perino, is only a quarter of a century previous to that of
Can Grande, who died in 1375, which was by Bonino da
Campione.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196"  class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Yet between the two there lies an immense
development of style. In Perino's work there are the
seeds of all the forms in Bonino's, but in one the
Gothic style is undeveloped, in the other it is in full
flower.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>Perino has his columns; his cusped pointed arches with
high gables above them; his tabernacles, pinnacles, and
pyramidal roof, with an equestrian statue on the summit;
but his lines are simple, direct, and unbroken, though enriched
here and there with reliefs and figures. In Bonino's
the columns are richly carved, the arches lavishly cusped,
the tympanum filled with sculptured medallions. The tabernacles
are richer and more emphatically Gothic in their
lengthened lines and multiplied pinnacles. The figures even
have grown into more true proportions, and are elongated
into gracefulness. Every inch of the whole design is
foliated and rich to a degree&mdash;as beautiful a bit of Gothic
sculpture as any German or English cathedral can show,
but yet the work of pure Italians, and men of the Comacine
Guild.</p>

<p>The sepulchral monument of Gian Galeazzo Visconti in
the Certosa of Pavia is of an entirely different style to those
of the Scaligers. It is principally the work of Gio. Antonio
Amedeo, and has the same ornate Renaissance style as
the façade of the Certosa in which he assisted. An arched
base contains the sarcophagus, on which rests the beautiful
and dignified figure of the Duke, guarded at head and foot
by classic angels. Above this is a statue of the Virgin and
Child in a central niche, flanked by reliefs of scenes from
the life of the Duke. The whole surface of the marble
is covered with sculpture, but of a style removed as far as
the poles from the work of the Comacine Guild, 800
years back. There all was life and <i>naïveté</i>, here all
is classical decorum and convention. Pilasters covered
with armour and coats of mail like a Roman trophy, friezes
of set garlands and shields like a Roman pediment, vases
with conventional plants rising stiffly out of them. The
severe architectural lines are straight and unbroken; here
are no Gothic pinnacles and graceful shrines, no ornamental
gables or pyramids, only the plain arch and pediment classically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
set and correct. The Italians had revived the Roman;
and the Renaissance style was the result. Comacine art
began with true Roman, and ended with a return to a false
classicism, that with rule and line crushed out the life of
the rich Gothic floriation.

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />

CIVIL ARCHITECTURE OF THE ROMANESQUE ERA</h3>

<p>The Comacines were always fine fortress builders from
the early times, when they fortified not only their own
island and city against the Goths, and against their civil
foes at Milan, etc., but also other cities which had foes to
keep off. Their towers and forts were so solid and strong
that their builders were taken by Justinian to the East to
build castles there, with the strong battlemented walls
which aroused Procopius's admiration, and which he confesses
were called <i>Castelli</i>, because that was the Italian
name for them.</p>

<p>After the eleventh century, when the Communes were
formed, the building of the fortress was less frequent, and
the Communal Palace took its place. The guild was
always gradual in its adoption of new styles, and the palace
of the Podestà or the "Signoria" differed only in form, and
not in style, from the older castle. There is the same solid
masonry&mdash;either <i>opus Gallicum</i> of smoothly-hewn stones
fitted with nicety, or <i>opus Romanum</i> of flat wide bricks
welded together with cement till they are strong as a
Roman wall. There are the same battlements and cornice
of arches supported on brackets; and wherever a window is
needed, high enough to be safe without an iron grating, it
is invariably of the old Lombard form, with its two round
arches enclosed in a larger one. There was the same
pillared courtyard with its flight of steps to the upper floor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Jacopo Tedesco's Bargello at Florence, his Castle at Poppi,
and his Palazzo Pubblico at Arezzo are the most beautiful
examples of this style.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_369" id="i_369"></a>
<img src="images/i_369.jpg" width="579" height="364" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Capital of a Column in the Ducal Palace, Venice.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_253">See page 253.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Arnolfo's Palazzo Vecchio, the Palazzo of the Commune
at Siena, and the Palazzo Pubblico at Pistoja show the next
step towards a less military style. There still remains
much of the fortress, in the solidity and rigidity of the
masonry below, and the battlemented lines above, but the
tower is no longer a solid weapon of war; it becomes an
airy ornamental shrine for a peaceful civic bell, that rings
for the joys and sorrows of the people.</p>

<p>These buildings may stand as the fair examples of the
work of the Masonic Guild for the thirteenth century; in
the fourteenth and fifteenth the style changed gradually
towards less rigid lines. The windows were widened and
cusped, and the arches over the archlets of the windows
became pointed; a gable with crockets placed above the
windows still further lightened the effect, and emphasized
the new Gothic influence. The ancient Palace of the Priors
and Palazzo del Popolo, which stand close together at Todi,
of which we give an illustration, show this progress in a
very marked degree. There is just the difference between
the two buildings that there lies between the palace of King
Desiderius at S. Gemignano, and the Palazzo Vecchio of
Florence. The Palazzo Pubblico, at Perugia, with its
noble Ringhiera and Loggia, might be taken as the culminating
point of Romanesque civil building. Its principal
doorway is a masterpiece of Comacine work. The Masters
have set their sign of the lion beneath the column, but both
lion and pillar are secularized; instead of the ecclesiastic
column, here is a square pilaster with niches containing
graceful figures of the civic virtues&mdash;justice, mercy, fortitude,
charity, etc. In the tympanum of the arch stand three
bishops, and over the architrave two other lions on brackets
mark the spring of the arch. The door is surrounded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
course upon course of beautiful mouldings, arabesques, and
spirals rich in the extreme. Though exceptionally beautiful,
yet if one compares this Palazzo Pubblico of Perugia
with other public edifices of its time in Italy, the similarities
are such that one cannot deny that a single influence must
have dominated them all.</p>

<p>In the Palazzo Pubblico at Udine, which was later, being
built in the fifteenth century by Giovanni Fontana of Melide
(Master of Palladio) and Matteo his son, we get the link
between these Romanesque civil buildings and the Venetian
Gothic. The upper windows have still the Lombard
columns, but the little arches are more ornately cusped and
gothicized. The colonnade forming the Ringhiera is
formed of decidedly pointed arches. There is in this a
marked affinity to the Venetian architecture, and its origin
accounts for it. The Fontanas were much employed at
Venice, and worked with the Lombardi, to whom Venice is
indebted for so much of her beautiful Gothic civil architecture.
In <i>cinquecento</i> times there was a great call on the
Masonic Guild for palaces. The republics had begun to
fade into principalities, wealth and aristocracy again got the
upper hand. The great churches were already built, and so
to employ the many great Masters of architecture and
sculpture whose families had for generations beautified
Italian cities, the dominant families in them vied with
each other in palace building.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_257">See page 257.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>In Florence the Medici led the way, the Strozzi following
them close. Then all the other old families, Guicciardini,
Rinuccini, Antinori, Borghini, etc., also called in
the masters of the Florentine Guild to make them palaces.
Cronaca, Sangallo, Baccio d'Agnolo, all names whose
ancestors were well known at either Siena, Orvieto, or in
Lombardy, made the plans and directed the works. And
one who compares these palaces one with another, cannot
but confess that different as were the hands that fashioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
them, one type and one style shows through them all, which
is to say that the architects were all brethren of the same
guild, and had received the same training. The Florentine
palace bore on its face the imprint of its race; you can trace
it gradually from the Brolio of Lombard times, through
the mediæval fortress, and the republican public palace.
Here in the Riccardi and Strozzi, the Pitti and Guadagni
Palaces, is the same solidity of architecture; but instead of
the smooth hewn blocks, the huge stones are left rough,
<i>alla rustica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197"  class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Here are the same shaped windows,
enlarged and beautified with tracery and mullion in place of
the ancient column, but directly derived from the older
form. Here is the ancient crown of Lombard archlets
diminished into a rich cornice; it is only in the older buildings
that the battlements are seen above, as in the Palazzo
Ferroni.</p>

<p>In the interior the cortile, with its arched and pillared
<i>loggie</i> around it, holds its own in the centre of the building.
There is little change of form between the Court of the
Palazzo Vecchio in 1299 and the Riccardi, Strozzi, and
a score of other private palaces of the fifteenth century.
The <i>loggia</i>, which was such an important feature in the
private house of the Republic, is now either relegated to
the garden front or the upper storey, where it is a delight to
the family itself, and is no longer the public meeting-place.
This is a difference entirely depending on a changed state
of society.</p>

<p>As in Florence, so it was in Milan, Venice, and
other cities where Masonic lodges were established in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
great church-building era. The nobles employed the
builders whose hands were craving for work. And what
palaces they built, and what a wealth of rich Gothic decoration
they lavished on them! We are indebted for most of
the Venetian Gothic palaces to the Buoni and Lombardi
families, whose course we have traced in the chapter on
Venice. The Renaissance buildings belong chiefly to the
members of the Florentine Lodge, such as Sansovino
and San Michele, who went to Venice in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>At Rome, where the Pope's rule was absolute, there
was less palace-building, but the Lombard Guild was
employed greatly in their old branch of fortress and
bridge building. The Masters Bartolommeo and Bertrando
of Como were engaged by Pope Pius II. to
strengthen the fortifications of S. Angelo. Maestro
Antonio of Como built the Ponte Lucano, Maestro
Antonio da Castiglione the Ponte Mammolo and Ponte
Molle. Maestro Manfredo da Como was commissioned
by Pius II. to build a new fortress on the heights of
Tivoli to defend the valley of the Anio from incursions
on the Abruzzi side. The following entries from the
registers prove Maestro Manfredo's employment there&mdash;</p>

<p>"1461. August 12. Twenty-five ducats given to the
treasurer by command of his Holiness, to be paid to Maestro
Manfred the Lombard, to begin the castle of Tivoli (<i>roccha
di Tiboli</i>)."</p>

<p>"1462. May 14. To Maestro Manfredino, builder, 200
gold florins on account of the works at the fortress of
Tivoli."</p>

<p>"1462. October 6. 400 <i>ducats di camera</i> to Master

<p>Pope Sixtus IV. employed Giovanni di Dolci to build
the citadel of Civita Vecchia, which Baccio Pontelli
finished after Giovanni's death. Antonio di Giovanni da
Canobbio built the fort at Zolfanella in the same reign,
while Francesco di Pietro da Triviago, Francesco da Como,
and Giorgio Lombardo were joint architects of the castle at
Santa Marmella. So we see that nearly all the papal forts
were the work of Lombards connected with the Roman
Lodge. In their own native hills the Lombards were doing
similar works.</p>

<h3 >CHAPTER I<br />

THE SECESSION OF THE PAINTERS</h3>

<p>Painting is not generally supposed to be connected in
any great degree with architecture: indeed it has now
become a distinctly independent art. In the Middle Ages
I believe the case was different. The great primitive
Comacine Guild seems to have embraced all the decorative
arts, though especially sculpture, as integral branches of
architecture. There are indisputable proofs of the many-sided
nature of the training in a Comacine <i>laborerium</i>.
There were <i>Magistri insigneriorum</i>, or Master architects;
<i>Magistri lapidum</i>, or sculptors, and <i>Magistri lignorum</i>, or
master carpenters. These latter seem in old times to have
been the designers of scaffoldings and makers of beams
for roofing; wood-carvers and inlayers were called <i>Maestri
d'intaglio</i>. Then there were certainly ironworkers and
masters in metal, and fresco-painters, who also attained to
the rank of Master. But no one branch was entirely separate
from the others, until the fourteenth century, when the
painters' companies were founded. We find the same man
building, designing, sculpturing, painting, and even working
in gold or iron, and seeming equally good in all styles,
so that the training of the <i>laborerium</i> must have been
especially comprehensive.</p>

<p>The reason appears to be that all the fine arts&mdash;painting,
sculpture and metal-working&mdash;were considered by the Comacines
as indispensable handmaids to architecture, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
builder was in their eyes fit to be a Master till he could
not only erect his edifice, but adorn it. Their symbolic
church was to them a kind of Bible, figuring all the points
of creeds, but the building itself was but the paper and
binding of the Bible; the sculptor put the frontispiece
which explained its inner meaning, and the mosaicist and
fresco-painter added as it were the letter-press and illustrations.
The churches of Ravenna show how full and rich
was this inner illustration, how Christ and the Apostles,
angels and prophets, saints and martyrs, have shone on
those walls, a beautiful Bible picture-book for ages. That
this was the light in which the early Christians regarded
their churches is plain from many passages in the early
Fathers. St. Basil (<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 379) in preaching, says&mdash;"Rise
up, now, I pray you, ye celebrated painters of the good
deeds of this army. Make glorious by your art the
mutilated images of their leader. With colours laid on by
your cunning, make illustrious the crowned martyr, by me
too feebly pictured. I retire vanquished before you in
your painting of the excellences of the martyr, etc. etc."<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199"  class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is the description of a Christian shrine by St.
Gregory of Nyssa (fourth century)&mdash;"Whoso cometh unto
some spot like this, where there is a monument of the just
and a holy relic, his soul is gladdened by the magnificence
of what he beholds, seeing a house as God's temple
elaborated most gloriously, both in the magnitude of the
structure, and the beauty of the surrounding ornament.
There the artificer has fashioned wood into the shape of
animals; and the stone-cutter has polished the slabs to the
smoothness of silver; and the painter has introduced the
flowers of his art, depicting and imaging the constancy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the martyrs, their resistance, their torments, the savage
forms of their tyrants, their outrages, the blazing furnace
and the most blessed end of the champion; the representation
of Christ in human form presiding over the contest&mdash;all
these things as it were in a book gifted with speech;
shaping for us by means of colours, has he cunningly discoursed
to us of the martyr's struggles, has made this
temple glorious as some brilliant fertile mead. For the
silent tracery on the walls has the art to discourse, and to
aid most powerfully. And he who has arranged the
mosaics has made this pavement on which we tread equal
to a history." (From Father Mulroody's translation, in
<i>San Clemente</i>, pp. 34, 35. St. Gregory wrote before <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
395.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200"  class="fnanchor">[200]</a>)</p>

<p>No doubt the richness of colour in these Byzantine
mosaics inspired the taste for pictorial embellishment in the
interiors of buildings, and the Comacines, not having Greek
mosaicists at command, found an easier and quicker method
of writing their scriptures on their walls&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> fresco. The
first mention of frescoes is of those in the palace of Theodolinda,
where her Lombards were portrayed on the walls.
Several Lombard churches also retain signs of having been
frescoed.</p>

<p>But if one desires to see what the early Christian
Comacine could do in fresco, let him go to that interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Roman church of San Clemente, where some excavations
made in 1857 revealed the ancient fourth-century Basilica,
almost complete under the present one, which dates from
about the twelfth century. This ancient church was built
by St. Clement, the third bishop of Rome, and in it Gregory
the Great read his thirty-second and thirty-eighth homilies.
From the subterranean remains, with their grand ancient
marble pillars and the huge semi-circle of the tribune,
masked and built in though they are by the foundations of
the upper church, we judge that it was a far finer building
than the one above. Its walls were moreover covered with
frescoes, some of which are precisely similar in style to the
ones at S. Piero a Grado, also said to date before the tenth
century. The frescoes, which have been discovered on
the subterranean walls, are, as will be seen by our illustrations
of them, in three rows, which appear to be of three
different eras&mdash;two certainly. The upper band of saints
and martyrs are distinctly Byzantine in style, drawing, and
colouring. They show the usual rows of immobile saints
and martyrs in set robes with jewelled borders, which are
seen in the mosaics of the Ravenna churches. These
would, I believe, date from the fourth-century church, when
the Roman builders were employing Byzantine decoration.
The second row beneath this is of the more naturalistic
Comacine school, and would probably date from Pope
Hadrian's restoration in the eighth century. In these and
the frescoes of S. Piero a Grado one gets the veritable link
between the conventional Byzantine school and the naturalistic
Renaissance in Tuscany. Here are no longer icons or
abstract images of saints; the people are no longer rigid
and set, but are full of action and expression, though both
are imperfectly expressed. They are, in fact, real persons
and their stories. The life of St. Clement is all told in
scenes. There are even portraits of living people, such as
Beno di Rapizo and his wife Maria, who "for love of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
blessed Clement" caused the frescoes to be painted. Nor
are their children, the boy Clement (<i>puerulus Clemens</i>) and
little Atilia his sister, forgotten. They are veritable portraits,
for the face of Beno in two different scenes is
identical. The colouring, too, is unlike the Byzantine
saints above. Those are rich with solid heavy tints; these
are lighter, and more in the style of the early Sienese or
Tuscan ones. Beneath this row of scenes are ornamental
friezes, in which one recognizes Roman classical forms
naturalized into floriated scrolls, and under these a line of
panelling in fresco. One panel appears to be copied from
the mosaic of the ceiling at the circular church of Sta.
Costanza; another is suggestive of the emblematic circles
and signs of the Catacombs. A third, the most interesting
of all, is the one commemorating the building of the church
to which we have before referred. Here stands Sisinius, and
whether he be the hero of St. Clement's miracle, as Father
Mulroody asserts, or not, he is certainly a Master architect
standing in his toga, and wearing a Freemason's apron
under it, directing his men, Albertus, Cosma, and Carvoncelle,
in the moving of a column. The figures in this are
so much more rude and out of drawing than the ones above,
that they scarcely would seem to be by the same hands.
I account for it by the fact that in representing a natural
sketch from real life, the artist had no traditionary models
to guide him, as he had for his saints and virgins, and consequently
he found it difficult to depict his fellow-workmen
in complicated attitudes. The art of the Catacombs has no
affinity with these frescoes, which are of a more free and
natural style, and the true ancestors of the Tuscan school
of fresco-painting.</p>

</div>

<p>We might place these as the earliest revival of nature
after the Byzantine conventional influence was withdrawn;
the next link is to be seen in the church of S. Piero a Grado,
three miles from Pisa, where are extant by far the finest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
specimens of Comacine fresco-painting. The church, which
I have described in the chapter on the Carlovingian era,
was built soon after the time of Pope Leo III. (795-816).
The frescoes are said to date before <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000. Like those
of St. Clement they are not Byzantine, and yet, though full
of life and action, they have an Eastern air; they are not
like the later Tuscan art, the colouring being lighter and
the drawing of the figures different. The prevailing tint is a
beautiful ethereal pale green, which is like nothing in Tuscan
art, though Peruzzi produced a tint something like it in the
sixteenth century. Standing at one end of the church and
looking down the nave, one could imagine a Ravenna
church, with its mosaics softened and toned down into
frescoes. They are a valuable proof that among the Comacine
Masters pictorial decoration was considered an integral
part of a building. They told the articles of their creed in
their sculptures outside, but they wrote the history of the
church on the walls inside. The story of the church in the
abstract is told in the line of popes above the arches, ending
at Leo III.; the story of this church in particular is told in
large scenes above them. Here is the church as it looked
when built, and here is the ship of St. Peter cast ashore at
Grado, and his preaching and baptizing, imprisonment, etc.
In fact all his life still glows, though fading out on the
south wall. The north wall is given to his death and
miracles. Here is his crucifixion, near an obelisk on the
Janicular Hill, and the beheading of his fellow-martyr St.
Paul at the Tre Fontane, with the mysterious blood-red
bird that drank his blood. Another scene shows the Pope
Symmachus (<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 498) disinterring the bodies of the two
Saints, and his vow of building S. John Lateran, and the
last scene shows his consecration of that church. It is
interesting to mark the Comacine influence in the drawing.
The towers are Lombard towers, and the buildings all have
round apses. The people who are not ecclesiastic or saints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
seem to be Longobardic, with reddish tunics, leather-thonged
sandals, and long hair. As for the lions, which lie waiting
before the cross of St. Peter, they are in the precise form of
the crouching lions beneath a Comacine arch. The drawing
of other beasts shows that the artists were less accustomed
to them than to their traditional lions.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_270">See page 270.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>If it be true that these frescoes, like the ones beneath
San Clemente, were really of the ninth or tenth centuries,
and if they were by native artists, this would place Pisa far
before Siena in the history of art, and Merzario would be
wrong when he asserts that there was no school of art in
Pisa before the cathedral was begun. The state of art in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries strongly inclines me to
place these Byzantino-naturalistic paintings, according to
legend, in the ninth century&mdash;that is, before the fall of art,
which took place during the times of German invasion and
feudal oppression after Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Certainly Cimabue, who is called the "Father of
Tuscan Art," could not have painted them, though in the
revival of his time he may have studied them, as earlier
works of his guild, for we have documental evidence of his
connection as a <i>Magister</i> with the Pisan Lodge. The first
great painter of that lodge was Giunta di Pisa, sometimes
written <i>Magister Juncte</i>. He was the son of a still older
painter, Guidotto dal Colle, who was a Master in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1202,
and lived till 1255.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201"  class="fnanchor">[201]</a> We give a facsimile of an old print
showing two of his paintings, one a figure from the fall of
Simon Magus, in the church of St. Francis at Assisi;
another a St. John from an ancient crucifix in S. M. degli
Angeli at Assisi. The Byzantine style in Cimabue's
painting may be traced to the influence of Giunta, of whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
an ancient writer, Padre Angeli, when speaking of his
paintings at Assisi, says&mdash;"that though his teachers were
Greeks, yet he learned his art in Italy, about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1210."<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"  class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
This is a proof of the connection of Eastern artists with the
Western architects.</p>

<p>Giunta, who became a <i>Magister</i> in 1210, preceded
Giotto by a century, in the frescoes of St. Francis of Assisi,
where among other things he painted a crucifix with Frate
Elias kneeling at the foot. Brother Elias was a scholar of
St. Francis, and contemporary with Giunta himself, who
has inscribed on his crucifix&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>FRATER ELIAS FIERI FECIT</p>
<p>JESU CHRISTE PIE</p>
<p>MISERERE, PRECAUTIS HELIC.</p>
<p>GIUNTA PISANUS ME PINXIT A.D. 1236. IND. 9.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Morrona has reproduced, by a copper engraving, a
veritable work of Giunta's&mdash;a crucifix with the Holy Father
above, and the Madonna and St. John at the sides, which
was for many years left in the smoke of the kitchen of the
Monastery of St. Anna at Pisa. There is a decided effort
to overcome the stiffness of his first Byzantine teachers, and
a good deal of lifelike expression in the smaller figures.
The same leaning toward nature is visible in the figures
of his <i>Fall of Simon Magus</i> at Assisi. Del Valle and
Morrona, judging by evidences of style, assert that Giunta
di Pisa was the master of Cimabue. But as Giunta
graduated as <i>Magister</i> in 1210, and Cimabue was not born
till 1240, this does not seem possible. It is more likely, in
regard to time, that Guido of Siena, painter of the famous
Madonna in San Domenico, may have learned something
of Giunta; but as all three of these primary Masters, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
of whom became the head of the painting school in his
own lodge, were members of the great guild, the source of
instruction might have been common to all, and moreover
that source must have been originally or partly Byzantine.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_271">See page 271.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>While mentioning that Giunta learned of Greek masters
in Italy, we may note that Vasari, <i>à propos</i> of Cimabue,
tells a story of the Florentines calling in Greek masters to
teach painting there. The assertion has been much derided
by modern authors, but it might contain a grain of truth
after all. Taking it with the fact (which becomes impressed
on us the more we study early Comacine churches) that
the architecture is Roman, and the ornamentation shows a
Greek influence naturalized, we get at what may be the
truth; that the Byzantine brethren who joined the guild
after the edict of Leo the Isaurian, still had their descendants
in it, among the ranks of the painters, as the
Campionese and Buoni families had for centuries theirs
among the architects. This would account for Andrea
Tafi working, together with Apollonius the Greek, at the
mosaics in the tribune of the Florentine Baptistery.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203"  class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Del Migliore, in his <i>Aggiunte</i> to Vasari's <i>Lives</i>, says
that in a contract dated 1297 he read "Magister Apollonius
pictor Florentinus." Here we get one of the very Greek
masters Vasari has been derided for mentioning, and he is
certainly connected with the Masonic lodge.</p>

<p>With a common origin, each lodge nevertheless developed
its own distinct style, yet so much was general to the whole
guild, that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries one
spirit seemed to permeate them all, and only experts can
tell a Lorenzetti from a Memmi, or a Giotto from a
Spinello Aretino. We find them working now in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
lodge, now in another. Cimabue, though his principal
work was in Florence where his school was, is found
working in the Pisan Lodge in 1301.</p>

<p>The archives of the Duomo there have three documents
of that year referring to him. One proves the payment of
X solidi II libr. a day to "Magister Cimabue" and his
<i>famulus</i> (apprentice) for their work there. Who knows
whether the <i>famulus</i> may not have been young Giotto,
or Joctus, as he is written in old deeds!</p>

<p>The second paper is Cimabue's receipt for the payment
by the <i>Lord operaio</i> (<i>Dominus operarius</i>) for a figure of
St. John, painted for that guild (<i>Magiestatem</i>).</p>

<p>The third seems to be the payment for a coloured glass
window which had been painted on glass by Baccio, son of
Jovenchi of Milan, from Magister Cimabue's design.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204"  class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Cimabue's school in Florence must have prospered
greatly. A long list of names of painters between 1294
and 1296, who are qualified and who agree to teach their
art in Florence, may be made from an ancient law register
kept at that date by the notary Ser Matteo Biliotti, which
is preserved in the general archives of Contracts in
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"  class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Here we find several of the Masters trained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
at Pisa, such as Lapo de Cambio, Lapo di Beliotto, Lapo
di Taldo, Corso di Buono, Andrea di Cante, Grifo di
Tancredi, Tura di Ricovero, Vanni di Rinuccio, Michele
di Pino, Ranuccio di Bogolo, Guiduccio di Maso, Cresta di
Piero, Bindaccio di Bruno, Guccio di Lippo, Bertino della
Marra, Rossello e Scalore di Lettieri, Dino and Lippo
Benivieni, Asinello d'Alberto, Lapo di Compagno, called
Scartapecchia, Vanuccio di Duccio, and Bruno di Giovanni,
the companion of Buffalmacco and Calandrino, of whom
Vasari tells such funny stories.</p>

<p>Another act, dated 1282, is a contract by which Azzo,
son of the late Mazzetto painter, of the parish of S.
Tommaso, engaged to teach his art for six years to Vanni
di Bruno; probably Giovanni the father of Bruno mentioned
above.</p>

<p>Rossello di Lottieri was the great-grandfather of Cosimo
Rosselli. Vanuccio was the son of the famous Duccio of
the Sienese Lodge. Indeed I think we could find, by close
investigation, that most of these <i>Magistri pittori</i> were
connected with one or other of the Tuscan Lodges.</p>

<p>Painters abounded in the guild at this era. There was
Tommaso de Mutina (Modena) whose Madonna painted in
1297 is in the Gallery at Vienna. There was Margaritone
of Arezzo (1216-1293), a great tre-cento painter of
Madonnas and crucifixes, whose works are yet preserved
in Florence, London, Siena, etc. He generally signed
them "Margarit . . . de Aretio pingebat." A portrait of
St. Francis, however, in the Capuchin Convent at Sinigaglia,
is inscribed "Margaritonis devotio me fec. . ." A
Madonna enthroned in the church at Monte San Savino is
not only signed but dated 1284. Guido of Siena and
Margaritone were the leaders of that flourishing school
at Siena which culminated in Spinello Aretino and the
Lorenzetti, one of whom, Lorenzo Monaco, rivalled our
Fra Angelico.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>Various painters are found in Pisa up to the fourteenth
century, artistic descendants from the school of Giunta.
Signor Morrona (<i>Pisa Illustrata nelle Arti del Disegno</i>,
vol. ii. p. 154) gives a list of Giunta's scholars. There are
Bonaventura and Apparecchiato da Lucca, Dato Pisano,
Vincino da Pistoja, a list which proves the affinity between
all the Tuscan schools. A little later in 1321 we find a
certain Vicino of Pisa as Gaddo Gaddi's scholar in Florence,
where he finished his master's mosaics in the Baptistery.
Ciampi has written a long dissertation to prove that Vicino
of Pisa ought to be Vincino of Pistoja, because he has found
the latter name in some documents. But as his documents
refer to paintings done by Vincino of Pistoja in 1290, and
the mosaics of Vicino and Gaddi date 1321, it seems more
probable they were really two different men&mdash;one, the Pistojan,
being the scholar of Giunta at Pisa mentioned above;
the other, the Pisan, a scholar of Gaddi in Florence somewhat
later. In 1302 we find painters from all the lodges
assembled in Pisa. Here are Magister Franciscus, painter
from S. Simone, named as a <i>Magister</i> of the highest rank.
He works with his son Victorius, and his apprentice Sandruccio.
Here are Lapo of Florence, Benozzo Gozzoli,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206"  class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
and "Michaelis the painter"; Duccio and Tura of Siena,
painters; and Datus Pictor, who might be that Dato
Pisano mentioned as a scholar of Giunta.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207"  class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>The books of the Duomo of Pisa contain among other
things an entry which indicates the use of oil-painting long
before the time of Antonello de Messina. It is nothing
less than the payment by the <i>Provveditore</i> of the <i>Opera</i> for
29 lbs. of turpentine, 104 lbs. of linseed oil at 28 denari
per lb., and 43 lbs. of varnish, all of which were for the use
of the painters of the <i>operam Magiestatis</i>. The entry is
dated 1301, and is No. 26 in the books of the <i>Provveditore</i>
of the <i>Opera</i> at Pisa in the year MCCCI. "Johannes
Orlandi sua sponte dixit se habuisse ad Operario libras
duas den. pis. pro pretio libre viginti novem trementine
operate adoreram Magiestatis.</p>

<p>"Libras quinquaginta quatuor, et solidos decem et octo
den. pisanorum minutorum pro pretio centinarum quatuor
olei linseminis ad operaio Magiestatis, et aliarum figurarium
que fiunt in majori Ecclesia, ad rationem denariorum
XXVIII pro qualibet libra."</p>

<p>Upechinus Pictor<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208"  class="fnanchor">[208]</a> pro libris quadraginta tribus vernicis
emptis Comunis an. 1303, is named as a painter of Pisa.</p>

<p>These entries clearly prove what a large part the
painters took in the work of the Masonic brotherhood, and
how the frescoing of the wall was a component part of a
Comacine church, and carried on, like their building, by the
joint labour of many Masters. If proof of this is wanting,
go where you will in Italy, and if you can find any church
that has a wall of its original early Christian or mediæval
building remaining, of any age between the fourth and
the fourteenth century, scratch that wall, and you will find
frescoes have been there. For instance, in Santa Croce,
and San Miniato at Florence, and at Fiesole, wherever the
restorer's plaster has been taken off, precious works of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
old Masters have come to light. But in all these we have
to imagine what a mediæval church was like from the
fragments that remain: to see the real Comacine church of
the twelfth or thirteenth century, one must go to the ancient
city of San Gimignano with its many towers, where they
remain untouched by the restorer, and unwhitewashed
by the seventeenth-century destroyer. There the whole
churches, every inch of them, are covered with scripture
or saintly story in glowing colours. Our illustration shows
one by Barna of Siena before the painters seceded.</p>

<p>The Spanish chapel at S. Maria Novella is another
unspoiled and entire specimen of the profuse use of fresco
by the guild. Most of these churches were decorated by
fresco artists who belonged to the Masonic Guild before
the secession of the painters, and being so, it is probable
that they worked together, as the architectural Masters were
accustomed to do, and this would account for the difficulty
of distinguishing in the Spanish chapel between the work
of the Memmi and that of the Lorenzetti, who certainly
worked together at Siena, and probably also in Florence.
Cimabue and Giotto were undoubtedly <i>Magistri</i> of the
Masonic Guild, for both of them were builders as well as
painters, and were employed together with other Masters.</p>

<p>When Cimabue discovered Giotto drawing his sheep,
he took him into his school in the lodge, he being then a
qualified Master. But the boy must have passed his novitiate,
not only in Magister Cimabue's own <i>atelier</i>, but also in the
wider teaching of the school and <i>laborerium</i>, or he would
never have got the commission to build the tower, nor the
power to sculpture his "Hymn of Labour" around it.</p>

<p>This was the era when pictorial art was freeing its wings
from the shackles of tradition and set conventionalism, and
from the bondage of working under the rule of another art
like architecture. The painters, especially when the oil
process was invented, saw a new and independent career
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
open before them, and struck for freedom. The Sienese led
the way. In 1355 they seceded from the Masonic Guild,
and even forsook their four crowned Saints; inaugurating
their own company under the banner and protection
of St. Luke. They called it <i>L' Arte de' Pittori Senesi</i>.
In reading their laws<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209"  class="fnanchor">[209]</a> one cannot but recognize that they
were framed on the same lines as those of the Masonic
Guild, the chief changes being the difference of patron
saint, and the omission of some technical rules relating
especially to architecture.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_278">See page 278.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The names of the artists forming this first school of
painting are sufficient proof of their former connection with
the Comacine Guild. Here is Francesco di Vannuccio,
who was called in a council of the <i>Opera</i> in 1356, and
Lando di Stefano di Meo, whose name appears first in the
Masonic Guild, and then among the painters; Andrea di
Vanni, whose father and ancestors had been in it, and who
in 1318 was himself working in the Duomo of Siena with
his father, where he is entered in the books as Andreuccio
(poor little Andrea) di Vanni. There are sundry other
members of the Vanni family, some of whom were on the
lists of the Masonic Guild before they are found as painters.
Then there was Bartolo, son of Magister Fredi, with his
son Andrea and grandson Giorgio. Bartolo must have been
an old man at this time, so that his frescoes at S. Gimignano
would have been done before the painters seceded. We
find also Andrea and Benedetto di Bindo in 1363 inscribed
in the roll of "Magistri lapidum," and in 1389 in that of the
painters; several of their family have also enrolled themselves
there. This Magister Bindo was a Lombard from
Val D'Orcia; other Comacine names are there also, such
as Domenico di Valtellino, and Cristofano di Chosona
(Cossogna, near Pallanza).</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>I believe that after this secession the churches were no
longer so entirely decorated with frescoes. Altar-pieces,
introduced by Giotto and Lorenzo Monaco, partially took
their place.</p>

<p>In 1386 the painters of the Florentine Lodge followed
the example of their <i>confrères</i> at Siena, and put themselves
also under the protection of St. Luke. They called themselves
the <i>Confraternità dei Pittori</i>. The meeting-place
of this Confraternity was in the old church of S. Matteo,
now no more. Their first company lasted till the time of
Cosimo I., who patronized it, and superintended its reorganization
in 1562.</p>

<p>In Medicean times great <i>fêtes</i> were held on St. Luke's
Day, by the Academy, and all the best pictures in Florence
were hung in the cloisters of the Servite monks.</p>

<p>By the time of the Grand Dukes the Masonic Guild seems
to have decayed. Owing to the new painting, sculpture,
and gold-working companies, which had freed themselves
from the old organization; and the secularizing of art which
followed from these causes, and from the diminished zeal for
church-building, the Freemasons must have dwindled away,
and the guild died a natural death. Cosimo again revived
and united the three sister branches of Art&mdash;Architecture,
Sculpture, and Painting&mdash;in his <i>Accademia delle Belle Arti</i>,
where they remain to this day. The ensign of the Academy
was a group of three wreaths, bay, olive, and oak, with the
motto&mdash;"<i>Levan di terra al ciel nostro intelletto</i>."</p>

<p>Lorenzo il Magnifico had paved the way to the revival
of sculpture by the school he started in his gardens. The
Academy has now a fine building for itself, and a very interesting
collection of paintings, chiefly of the early schools.</p>

<p>Here we will leave the painters, who no longer have
any connection with the great Masonic Guild. That fraternity,
nevertheless, forms the link of connection between the
old classic art and the Renaissance in painting, as in all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
other branches. Without it we should have had no grand
frescoes by Giotto, the Lorenzetti, the Memmi, and the
Gaddi, for the lodges at Siena and Florence trained their
art; and it is a certain fact that after the secession of the
painters, the glorious days of fresco-painting were over.
The painters no longer worked together to beautify every
inch of the churches built by the brotherhood, but they
painted for themselves, for personal fame and money.
Madonnas, votive pictures, and portraits multiplied: the
commission and the patron ruled the art. Imagination and
inspiration rarely dominated, except in rare cases like Fra
Angelico, Fra Bartolommeo, Raphael, and Michael Angelo,
and other of the greatest Masters who stand forth from the
crowd of artists, endowed with true genius.

<p>At first sight it would not appear that the Italian-Gothic
cathedrals at Siena and Orvieto could have much to do
with the ancient Comacine church of S. Michele at Pavia,
but they are undoubtedly its hereditary descendants, and
in great part the work of Comacine architects.</p>

<p>Documents prove that a Lombard Guild, with <i>schola</i>,
<i>laborerium</i>, and <i>Opera</i>, existed in Siena long before <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
1400. Legend, or rather tradition, says that this lodge
began in Longobardic days, when the first Sienese Duomo
was built by a certain Ava, descendant of Iselfred, a Longobardic
prince. This Ava had, before going to Siena,
caused a church (Aula Santa) to be erected "on an island
near Borgonuovo by the lake" (Insula prope Borgonuovo
juxta lacus). This must be the Comacine island on the
lake near Como-nuovo, which was also called Borgonuovo.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212"  class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
It is also said that in 1180 Pope Alexander III. went to
Siena, of which city he was a native, to consecrate the new
Basilica.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213"  class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Here we have the first link of the Comacine Guild with
Siena, and I think it offers an explanation of the early
existence of the Sienese school of painting.</p>

<p>The Longobardic Masonic lodge seems to have been
the only one of the kind then in Siena, and it held on for
almost a century after the secession of the painters in
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1355.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>By that time so many native architects and sculptors had
been trained that there were two distinct parties in the
guild, and the Sienese clique began to feel the need of independent
power. In 1441 a schism was made, the Sienese
sculptors forming a branch of their own, called <i>L'arte dei
maestri di pietra, Senese</i>, which had its laws and regulations
in due form. The same schism had taken place in Venice
in 1307, when the <i>Arte de taglia pietre</i> was formed, and
a similar one took place later in Florence. The Sienese
split was not very satisfactory, for on December 5, 1473, we
find they called a meeting of the two guilds, to further the
means of working in better accord with each other. The
following compact was made&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That all Masters, Lombard or Sienese, should pay
ten soldi for right of entry on employment.</p>

<p>(2) That all, equally, should pay five soldi a year for
the <i>festa</i> of the <i>Santi Quattro</i>; and that a Lombard
<i>camarlengo</i> should be chosen to work together with the
Sienese one, to collect these and other moneys; that the
<i>camarlengo</i> should hold no more in hand than twenty-five
soldi; all money above that to be immediately
invested.</p>

<p>(3) That the Lombard <i>camarlengo</i> shall be subject to
the same laws and rules and fines as the Sienese one.</p>

<p>(4) That the <i>garzoni</i> (novices or pupils) shall have no
claims to receive pay, but manual labourers shall be paid
three soldi a year each by the Masters employing them, as
says the statute.</p>

<p>(5) That when it is necessary to "make a collection,"
the Lombard Masters shall be obliged to attend, equally
with the citizens, and under the same penalties, as by the
statute. Here follow the names of the contracting parties,
as inscribed in the original report of the meeting.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214"  class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>But even this did not succeed. On January 6, 1512, we
find the Sienese Lodge making a petition to the Signoria to
the effect that whereas in ancient times the brethren of the
Masonic Guild were always accustomed to hold their meetings
and unite for worship in their own chapel of the <i>Santi Quattro</i>
in the cathedral, the "foreign" builders being now separated
from that chapter (lodge), all the money which used to be
collected to endow that chapel, is now collected among
themselves, and sent to Lombardy, without consulting the
said chapter (<i>capitudine</i>), "to the grave injury and shame
of our city, and of the said chapel," "thus we pray of your
Signoria that you will command that the said lodge shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
meet according to the ancient rules of the order, under pain
of penalties named in the ancient Breve ... the which
shall be useful and honourable to our city and to the said
chapel."<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215"  class="fnanchor">[215]</a> By this we realize that the Lombard Masters
were not only the earliest guild of architects at Siena, but
also the most powerful, as the Sienese branch could not
even keep up the chapel of their patron saint without their
aid.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to glance over the headings of the
statutes of the Sienese Masonic Guild, which no doubt were
similar to, if not identical with the original one; at any rate
they will throw light on the organization.</p>

<p>Cap. I. On he who curses God or the Saints (a fine of
twenty-five lire).</p>

<p>Cap. II. On he who opposes the Signoria of the city
(a fine of twenty-five lire).</p>

<p>Cap. III. On the election of <i>rettore</i> and <i>camarlengo</i>.
(In the Florentine Lodge which kept up the older Latin,
these are called <i>caput magister</i> and <i>provveditore</i>.)</p>

<p>Cap. IV. On the forming of councils and their duration.</p>

<p>Cap. V. How to treat underlings (<i>sottoposti</i>).</p>

<p>Cap. VI. On those who disobey the rector or
<i>camarlengo</i>.</p>

<p>Cap. VII. On he who refuses a citation (fine of twenty
soldi).</p>

<p>Cap. VIII. Of one who swears by the blood or body of
God.</p>

<p>Cap. IX. Of he who takes work on a risk.</p>

<p>Cap. X. All names of <i>sottoposti</i> to be written in the
Breve.</p>

<p>Cap. XI. That no one may take work away from
another Master.</p>

<p>Cap. XII. Contracts with pupils must be made before
the <i>camarlengo</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>Cap. XIII. How the feast of the Four Holy Martyrs
is to be kept.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216"  class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Cap. XIV. On the entry of a foreign Master into the
guild.</p>

<p>Cap. XV. <i>Di chi vietasse il pegno al messo.</i> (I can get
no clear translation of this; I think it means a pledge on
receiving a commission.)</p>

<p>Cap. XVI. The <i>camarlengo</i> shall hand over all receipts
to the Grand Master.</p>

<p>Cap. XVII. On the salaries of officials of the guild.</p>

<p>Cap. XVIII. How <i>fêtes</i> must be kept (fines of five
soldi to all who work on <i>feste</i>. Forty-nine <i>fête</i> days
are named).</p>

<p>Cap. XIX. One who is sworn to another guild cannot
be either the Grand Master or <i>camarlengo</i>.</p>

<p>Cap. XX. That the <i>camarlengo</i> keeps for the guild
all moneys received from <i>sottoposti</i> (brethren of lower
rank).</p>

<p>Cap. XXI. On good faith in receiving a commission.</p>

<p>Cap. XXII. How members are to be buried.</p>

<p>Cap. XXIII. How to insure against risks.</p>

<p>Cap. XXIV. No arguments or business discussions to
be held in the public streets.</p>

<p>Cap. XXV. How the <i>fête</i> of the guild is to be kept,
the rectors to have full power to command.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>Cap. XXVI. How wax candles shall be sent to the
monks of the Mantellini for the <i>festa</i>.</p>

<p>Cap. XXVII. How tithes are to be paid.</p>

<p>Cap. XXVIII. That all orders come from the Grand
Master.</p>

<p>Cap. XXIX. How the outgoing officials shall instruct
the new ones. (<i>i.e.</i> The council of administration which
was changed periodically.)</p>

<p>Cap. XXX. That no Master may undertake a second
work till the first has been paid.</p>

<p>Cap. XXXI. Brick-makers and quarry-men must abide
by the rules of the guild.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Cap. XXXIV. On those who lie against others.</p>

<p>Cap. XXXV. Those who demand a meeting or consultation
shall pay fifteen soldi to the guild.</p>

<p>Cap. XXXVI. That the Grand Master on retiring from
office shall call three <i>riveditori</i><a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"  class="fnanchor">[217]</a> to examine his accounts.</p>

<p>Cap. XXXIX. That no master of woodwork shall work
in stone.</p>

<p>Cap. XL. The <i>Breve</i> (statutes) shall be revised every
year.</p>

<p>Cap. XLI. On the entry into the lodge, of Masters from
the city or neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The statutes are very fair and well composed, and must
certainly have been made from long experience in the guild.</p>

<p>In 1447 we find a further split. The Masters of wood-carving
secede from the sculptors in stone, and form their
own statutes. Little by little, as art becomes more perfect
and requires more freedom, the Masonic monopoly of
centuries is dissolving.</p>

<p>We must now return to the building of the Duomo by
this multitude of brethren.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>It was in 1259 that the civic Council decided to continue
the work of restoration in the Duomo of Siena, and formed
a council of nine influential citizens, together with the
<i>Magistri</i> of the Masonic Guild, to superintend the work.
By February 1321 their ideas and ambitions had so enlarged
that they proposed to make the present church the
transept, and to add a great nave, "to make a beautiful and
magnificent church, with all rich and suitable ornamentation."
The new nave was really begun, and a high bare wall with
a fine window in it remains to this day to puzzle the tourist.
This vast design was, however, abandoned, and the building
continued on a less ambitious scale.</p>

<p>Now for details of all these changes. Before Giovanni
Pisano's time we only get a few quaint names such as
Magister Manuellus, son of the late Rinieri, who made the
stalls in the choir in 1259; Luglio Benintendi, Ventura
Diotisalvi, Magister Gratia or Gracii, Ristorus, Stefano
Jordano, Orlando Bovacti, nearly all of whom were Masters
from other lodges either in Lombardy or Pisa. There are
besides two other Venture&mdash;one Ventura di Gracii, and one
Ventura called Trexsa. All these are named as being
called in a council of the guild of June 9, 1260, to consider
the stability of some vaulting lately made, but I can find
no <i>capo magistro</i> at this date. Several of these are names
known in other cities where the guild had lodges. Ventura's
father, Diotisalvi, built the Baptistery at Pisa; Magister
Gracii came from Padua, Stefano Jordanus had a son,
Johannes Stephani, who was witness to Niccolò di Pisa's
receipt for payment by Fra Melano of 78 gold lire and
IV denarii for his pulpit in the Duomo on July 26, together
with Orlando, son of Orlando Bovacti, and Ventura
di Rapolano. Niccolò himself had with him his son Giovanni,
who also graduated in the guild from the school of
his father. Here, too, were Arnolfo, Lapo (the younger),
with Donato and Goro, who were students in Niccolò's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
school of sculpture, and who worked so well at the sculpture
at Siena that when they became <i>Magistri</i> in 1271, the
three last were given the freedom of the city.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218"  class="fnanchor">[218]</a> They were
not exclusively sculptors, however, any more than Arnolfo
was. Lapo was employed in 1281 as architect at Colle,
where Arnolfo's reputed father, the elder Lapo or Jacopo
il Tedesco, had been engaged by King Manfred long before
him. Goro di Ciucci Ciuti had three sons, Neri, Ambrogio,
and Goro, all in the guild. In 1306 we find them all
engaged together in the fountain of Follonica at Siena.
In 1310 Neri's sons Ciolo and Nuto are mentioned; one
of them, having graduated, is old enough to have a pupil,
named Teri. Here is the deed of apprenticeship&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>In 1281 a Grand Council was called to revoke the
banishment of one of the Lombard Masters, Ramo di Paganello.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219"  class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
It seems that Ramo's father was from Lombardy,
"de partibus ultramontanis;" but the son had been made
a citizen of Siena, whence he was exiled for contumacy.
However, he was such a good sculptor that the edict was
revoked. The report begins&mdash;</p>

<p>"1281, 20 Novembre.&mdash;Item cum Magister Ramus filius
Paganelli de partibus ultramontanis, qui olim fuit civis
senensis, venerit nunc ad civitatem Sen: pro serviendo
operi beate Marie de Senis; ex eo quod est de bonis intalliatoribus
et sculptoribus, et subtilioribus de mundo qui
inveniri possit: et ad dictum servitium morari non potest,
eo quod invenitur exbannitus et condenpnatus per contumaciam,
occasione quod debuit jacere cum quadam muliere;
eo existente extra civitatem Senensem: si videtur vobis
conveniens quod debeat rebanniri et absolvi de banno et
condenpnationibus suis, ad hoc ut possit libere et secure
servire dicto operi ad laudem et honorem Dei, et beate
Marie Virginis, in Dei nomine consulate."</p>

<p>The first head architect, who is definitely styled <i>Capo
maestro dell' Opera</i>, is Giovanni Pisano, who, when he
came to work with his father at the pulpit in 1266, seems
to have taken root in Siena, as did his fellow-pupils Lapo,
Donato, and Goro. Arnolfo, the fourth of the group, found
his mission in Florence.</p>

<p>Signor Milanesi has not succeeded in finding the document
referring to Giovanni da Pisa's election, but he finds
that, in 1284, the Sienese, in gratitude for the services he
has rendered in the building of the Duomo, and especially
the façade, gave him the freedom of the city, and immunity
from taxes.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220"  class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>Like most artists, Giovanni must have been Bohemian
in his ways, or careless in his political expressions, for in
October 1290 he was fined the large sum of 600 lire, and
had not the wherewithal to pay. He got off by paying a
third, but even this Fra Jacopo, one of the <i>Operai</i> of the
Duomo, had to advance. It was probably repaid from his
salary by instalments.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221"  class="fnanchor">[221]</a> From these documents we gather
that the façade was not designed by Lorenzo Maitani, as has
generally been supposed. If the Commune of Siena in 1284
acknowledged Giovanni's talent in building the Duomo and
the façade, Lorenzo Maitani, who only began to be chief
architect of Orvieto from 1310, certainly could not have
been old enough to design the front of Siena cathedral.
Moreover Milanesi expressly says that, with all his research
in the archives, he can find no mention whatever of
Maitani's being connected in any prominent manner with
Siena cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222"  class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He most likely worked at it as Giovanni's
pupil, and this, with the general tenets of the guild, would
sufficiently account for the similarity between the two
churches.</p>

<p>The tenets of the guild were certainly veering towards
the Gothic, and each generation of its members made a
new step. Jacopo Tedesco at Assisi, and Niccolò Pisano
in his pulpit, showed the first sign of transition; their sons
and pupils, Arnolfo at Florence, and Giovanni at Siena,
developed the style still further, and their successors fully
expanded it at Milan.</p>

<p>Giovanni was a lover of the Gothic, but was not yet
entirely converted. His windows, like Arnolfo's, were
pointed, the points emphasized by ornate Gothic gables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
over them; but the three arches of the doorways are of a
Lombard roundness, the pointed effect being only conveyed
by the superimposed gables. Yet the turrets and saint-filled
niches of the upper part of the façade are as rich,
and pointed, and pinnacled as any Gothic cathedral could
be. He had not discovered, as the Germans afterwards
did, the beauty of the upward line. The old classic leaning
to the horizontal line still cuts up the design; and the little
Lombard pillared gallery still stretches across the front,
though beautified and gothicized. He did not forget the
sign of the guild in this transition period; for there on the
columns, and beneath the arches, are the lions of Judah.</p>

<p>It is not positively certain whether the present façade
was the one originally designed by Giovanni or not.
We find that in November 1310, a commission of ten
Master builders was formed, to superintend the work of the
mosaic, already commenced, and to guard against useless
expenses. Milanesi supposes this to refer to some mosaics
destined for the façade, especially as in 1358 a Maestro
Michele di Ser Memmo was paid six gold florins for his
work, "per la sua fadigha (fatica) e magistero di Santo
Michele agnolo, a musaica (<i>sic</i>) che fecie a la facciata di
duomo nel canto."<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223"  class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The front, as it is at present, has no
mosaics; probably Giovanni Pisano's plan was modified
in later days. It is certain that after Giovanni's death in
1299 great changes of design were made.</p>

<p>The interior has the same mixture as the façade;
there are round arches below in the nave, and pointed
windows above in the clerestory. The black and white
marble, significant of the times though it be, detracts much
from the effect of the really fine architecture by cutting it
up in slices. Fergusson recognized the purely Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
pedigree of Siena cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224"  class="fnanchor">[224]</a> "That at Siena," he says,
"illustrates forcibly the tendency exhibited by the Italian
architects to adhere to the domical forms of the old
Etruscans, which the Byzantines made peculiarly their own.
It is much to be regretted that the Italians only, of all
the Western mediæval builders, showed any predilection
for this form of roof. On this side of the Alps it would
have been made the most beautiful of architectural forms."</p>

<p>We cannot, however, endorse Mr. Fergusson's next
assertion&mdash;"in Italy there is no instance of more than
moderate success&mdash;nothing, indeed, to encourage imitation."
In the face of the domes of St. Peter's at Rome, S. Marco
at Venice, the cathedrals of Florence, Parma, Padua, Siena,
and Monreale, this is rather a hard saying.</p>

<p>The Sienese had, as we have said, proposed to so
enlarge the church by adding a huge nave, that the present
church would only form the transept. This was begun,
but when the works had already advanced the plan was
abandoned. Provisional <i>Magistri</i> were called to form a
committee, which met in council on February 17, 1321, and
here, for the first time in Siena, we find Lorenzo Maitani
giving his vote. He was called to attend the meeting from
Orvieto, where he had been <i>capo maestro</i> of the works
from 1310. He, with Niccola Nuti, Gino di Francesco,
Tone di Giovanni, and Vanni di Cione (one of Orcagna's
relatives from Florence), formed the council. After due
deliberation they pronounced on the inconvenience of proceeding
with the addition to the Duomo, and decided to
build a new church of more moderate dimensions, which
should still be large and magnificent. The work now continued
without interruption; and on November 20, 1333,
we find another Council of Masters was called, in which
twelve of the guild severally swear "testis juratis die supra
scripta et sancta Dei evangelia, corporaliter tactis scripturis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
dicere veritatem, suo juramento testificando dixit," etc., that
the walls and foundations were strong and firm.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_295">See page 295.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The next <i>capo maestro</i> was Master Lando or Orlando
di Pieri, son of Piero, a metal-worker of the guild, who
was recalled from Naples in 1339. He was a Lombard,
though a naturalized citizen of Siena. They say Lando is
"a most legal man (<i>omo legalissimus</i>), not only in his own
special branch (gold-working), but in many others; is a man
of the greatest ingenuity and invention, both with regard to
the building of churches and the erection of palaces and
private houses; a good engineer for roads, bridges, or fountains,
and, above all, a citizen of Siena."<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"  class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Here we see
signs of the jealousy of the Lombard Guild, which caused
the schism of which we have spoken. Lando was truly an
acknowledged genius. He made the coronet with which
the Emperor Henry VII. was crowned at Milan in 1311.
Muratori (cap. xiii.), quoting an old Latin dissertation
on the "corona ferrea," says the maker of the crown
was present, "presente magistro Lando de Senis, aurifabro
predicti domini Regis, qui predictam coronam propriis manibus
fabricavit." We hear no more of his gold work; but
in 1322 he was employed in Florence to hang the great
bell of the palace of the Signoria, and make it ring (Ita
quod de facili pulsatur et pulsari potest), for which he was
paid 300 gold florins. In his architectural capacity he was
employed at Naples by King Robert of Anjou, but was
recalled from there to Siena in 1339, and made <i>caput
magister</i> of the builders of the Duomo. The contract,
signed on December 3, 1339, binds him for three years at
a salary of 200 lire a year.</p>

<p>The accounts of the <i>Opera</i> have some interesting
articles connected with the laying of the foundations of
the revised plan. In August 1339 the Masters were called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
into council on the enlargement of the Duomo, as the nave
was considered too short, and Ser Bindo, the notary of the
guild, had to supply them with five sheets of parchment at
one lire a sheet to make designs. Also two lire ten soldi
were spent in bread, meat, and wine, which were sent by
the guild to the priests who officiated when the first stone
was laid. In March, Maestro Lando again applied to Ser
Bindo for parchment to make designs, which cost him
twenty-three soldi six denari.</p>

<p>Whether these plans were accepted or not, I cannot tell&mdash;probably
not&mdash;for in the following March, Lando fell ill and
died. He left a son, Pietro di Lando, also in the guild, and
who was naturalized Florentine when he joined that lodge.
A document cited by Gaye (<i>Carteggio</i>, etc. vol. i. p. 73)
shows Pietro to have worked with Giovanni di Lazzero de
Como and a Buono Martini at the fortifications of Castel
S. Angelo in Val di Sieve; the three architects solicited the
Signoria for the pay due to them. This Pietro was the
father of Vecchietta, who inherited more than his great-grandsire's
talent for working metal.</p>

<p>The next <i>capo maestro</i> after Lando was Giovanni, son
of the famous sculptor Agostino of Siena, who was, on
March 23, 1340, elected for five years. He had been head
of the works at Orvieto in 1337, but did not long remain
there, for in 1338 we find him again in the pay of the lodge
of Siena, where a document in the archives of the Hospital
notes a payment for some work on April 26, to Maestro
Giovanni, son of Maestro Agostino of the <i>Opera</i>, and of the
parish of S. Quirico.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226"  class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>After Giovanni I can find no mention of a <i>capo maestro</i>
till February 16, 1435, when Jacopo della Quercia, otherwise
"Magister Jacobus, Magistri Petri," was elected <i>operajo</i>
(president of the Council), <i>i.e.</i> Grand Master. His salary
was fixed at one hundred gold florins as long as he lived, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
his wife was to have a pension at his death. There were
several conditions specified to which he had to agree. But he
had so many other engagements, at S. Petronio in Bologna, at
Parma, and Lucca, that he absented himself too much from
Siena to please the <i>Opera</i> there. As early as March
1434-35, a month after his election, we find him leaving two
of the Council of Administration to rule in his absence.
The absence must have been a lengthy one, for on October
22, 1435, the Signoria of the Commune write to him as
follows&mdash;"Magister Jacobo Pieri electus Operaio, etc. etc....
As you have been fully informed, you ought before
the past month to have taken action, and performed the
duties undertaken by you in regard to the office of <i>Operaio</i>
of our Church, to which our Councils elected you. We and
our councillors have waited all the past month, expecting
that, for the honour of the Commune, and its needs at
the hands of the said <i>Opera</i>, you would return. Now we
are at October 22, and you do not appear to think of it.
God knows how the citizens are complaining and murmuring
against you. Therefore we have decided to write to
you, that without fail, and with no delay, you must immediately
present yourself to perform your duties, and let nothing
hinder you. If you do not do this, it will cause us great
astonishment and inconvenience."<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227"  class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The Council of the <i>Opera</i> wrote a long Latin letter at
the same time, exhorting their chief to return and satisfy the
claims of the Commune. Whether he came or not I cannot
say, but it appears not for any length of time, as on March
26, 1436, we find him at Parma, writing a defiant kind of
letter to the <i>Operai</i> of San Petronio at Bologna, who had
appealed to him to finish his engagements there. By 1439
we find Jacopo della Quercia had died, and his brother Priam
was writing repeated petitions to the <i>Opera</i> at Siena about
his inheritance from Jacopo, which it seems a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
pupil of Jacopo's called Cino Bartoli was withholding from
him.</p>

<p>So the work went on for centuries. There are contracts
with different Masters for sculptures, for windows, for towers,
for chapels, each Master designing the part assigned to him.
Francesco del Tonghio obtained great fame for his carvings
of the stalls in the choir in 1377, where his son Giacomo
assisted him. We find him in Florence some time later,
and his fame must have preceded him, for he is known
there as "Francesco of the Choir" (Francesco del Coro).</p>

<p>It is impossible to name a single architect for any of
these great buildings; they were all the united work of a
self-governed guild.</p>

<p>During the centuries when the Duomo of Siena rose
into beauty, her sister of Orvieto also grew under the hands
of the same brotherhood.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Maitani, having been trained by his master,
Giovanni di Pisa, at Siena, was called to Orvieto in 1310.
His family lasted long in the guild, and won much fame.
His father Vitale was a master sculptor who had worked
under Niccolò and Giovanni. His sons Vitale and Antonio
both graduated in the Siena or Orvieto Lodge, and Vitale
became chief architect at Orvieto for six months only, on
Lorenzo's death, when Master Meo di Nuti di Neri
succeeded him.</p>

<p>It is not probable that beyond the design, Maitani had
much to do with the façade, which was incomplete till about
1500. The beautiful Bible in stone which adorns the
pilasters of the three fine doors may have been designed
by Maitani, but the work was done by his sons, with the
help of many sculptors of the guild from Siena, Florence,
and Lombardy. The upper part was not added till the
time of Michele Sanmichele of Verona, who in 1509 was
nominated chief architect of the façade at a salary of one
hundred florins a year. He is described as "Magistrum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Michaelem, Magistri Johannis de Verona, principalem
magistrum fabrice faciate de Urbe vetere."<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"  class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_435" id="i_435"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Door in Orvieto Cathedral.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_305">See page 305.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The enthusiastic work of the numberless artists all vying
with each other in beautifying this marvellous church bore
rather heavily on the funds of the <i>Opera</i>, for in August 1521
the <i>camarlengo</i> had to stop the expenses of the façade and
finish some more needful parts of the church first. So
"Mag. Michael Johannes Michaelis, Caput Magister dicte
Fabrice," was given permission to absent himself for three
days a week, for other work (no doubt the church at Spello),
and the <i>Opera</i> continued his salary on half-pay.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229"  class="fnanchor">[229]</a> About
this time a competition was offered among the <i>Magistri</i> for
the best design for the chapel of the Three Kings at
Orvieto. Antonio Sangallo and Michele were the two
best, and when Pope Clement VII. fled to Orvieto from the
sack of Rome in 1527, the choice was made with his concurrence,
Michele's being chosen. Both San Michele and
San Gallo rose to extreme eminence in the guild; many of
the finest palaces in Florence and Venice were by them.
It is interesting to find that they were both Lombard
brethren of the guild by hereditary descent.</p>

<p>The preponderance of Lombards in all these later lodges
is sufficient proof of the connection of these lodges with the
older Comacines, from whom their ancestry can be traced
direct.</p>

<p>In April 1422 we find Maestro Piero di Beltrami da
Biscione and his Lombard companions arranging with the
<i>Opera</i> for the purchase and cutting of marbles and travertine.
In September 1444 Guglielmo di Como and his brother
Pietro da Como were commissioned to make a mausoleum
in the Duomo for the Bishop of Siena. A contemporary of
theirs was Giuliano da Como, who was of such repute in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the guild, that the Council of the <i>Opera</i>, "considering the
<i>virtù</i> of Maestro Giuliano and the desirability of keeping him
in Siena, deliberated to accord to him a loan he requested,
of seventy florins to buy a house."<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"  class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Again, on May 25, 1421, the Republic of Siena wrote to
Filippo Visconti Duke of Milan that a Maestro Giovanni,
son of Maestro Leone da Piazza near Como, was anxious
to return to his native country, to see his family and to
arrange a law-suit; and they recommended him to the
Lords of Milan because he had greatly won the affection
and esteem of the Sienese republic by his good life and his
eminence in his art of sculpture.</p>

<p>A certain "Maestro Alberto di Martino de Cumo in
provincie Lombardie" was engaged by the <i>Opera</i> on March
2, 1448, as a builder, in company with Giovan Francesco of
Valmaggia and Lanzilotto di Niccola of Como.</p>

<p>When the Piccolomini wanted to build a splendid palace
in Siena, they did not choose their architects from the
faction of their townspeople, but from the original Lombard
branch. Martino di Giorgio da Varenna (near Bidagio on
Lake Como) was chief architect, and Lorenzo from Mariano
in the Lugano valley assisted him as sculptor. He carved
the beautiful capitals and friezes in the palace, and his work
so pleased the Piccolomini, that they employed him to
erect an altar and decorate their chapel in the church of
S. Francesco. Milanesi says that Lorenzo da Mariano was
one of the best artists of his time for foliaged scrolls and
grotesques.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231"  class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In 1506 he was <i>capo maestro</i> of the Duomo
of Siena. Maestro Lorenzo was no doubt one of the precursors
of the sculptors of the beautiful cathedral of Como,
and the richly ornate Certosa of Pavia, who were trained in
the Sienese <i>laborerium</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>A fellow-countryman, named Maestro Matteo di Jacopo,
came from Lugano with Lorenzo, and together with Maestro
Adamo da Sanvito (also in Val di Lugano) undertook the
great engineering work of making an artificial lake, to drain
the then malarious country round Massa in Maremma.</p>

<p>Martino di Giorgio had a relative who became more
famous than himself. This was Francesco di Giorgio di
Martino&mdash;three names in rotation are generally enough to
supply an Italian family for centuries,&mdash;who continued the
work at Palazzo Piccolomini (Vasari gives him the credit
for the whole), and was one of the architects of the palace
at Urbino.</p>

<p>Milanesi, the commentator of Vasari, asserts that Francesco
was the son of a seller of fowls in Siena, because he
found the name of a "Giorgio di Martino, pollajuolo," in the
registers, but seeing that he was bred in the guild, it is much
more likely that he was related to the Giorgio di Martino
already eminent there. His family had certainly become
citizens of Siena by that date.</p>

<p>Maestro Francesco di Giorgio Martini holds a large
share in the correspondence of the Sienese government and
of the <i>Opera</i> in the latter part of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>On December 26, 1486, we find him first entering the
pay of the Sienese Commune as public architect. He has
a salary of 800 florins, and is bound to fix his home at Siena.
He was recalled from Urbino for the purpose, having orders
to arrive within six months, but the Duke Guidobaldo was
not at all willing for him to leave. On May 10, 1489, the
Duke writes to say that the absence of his architect (<i>mio
architector</i>) would be a serious injury to him.</p>

<p>During the time Francesco remained in Umbria he
seems to have done the Commune good political service by
keeping them informed of the dangers that threatened
Florence from the offensive alliance between Lorenzo de
Medici and the Pope Innocent VIII., who designed to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Città di Castello for Francesco Cibo. This would have
endangered the peace of Siena, so the architect warned
them to be prepared.</p>

<p>After this, Magister Francesco became the bone of contention
among several princes and republics. The Duke of
Milan wrote, on April 19, 1490, to the Signoria of Siena,
begging them to send the "intellexerimus magistrum
Franciscum Giorgium Urbinatem" (see how the place he
last worked at is named as his residence!) to Milan to
give his opinion on the mode of placing the cupola. The
Commune gave the permission, and on June 27, 1490, we
find Magistro Francisco di Georgi di Siena (here again at
Milan he is styled of Siena), with Magistro Johantonio
Amadeo (Omodeo) and Johanjacobo Dolzebono (Gian
Giacomo Dolcebono), elected as a supreme council of three,
and giving their advice on the erection of the cupola at
Milan, with the exact plan and measurements which would
harmonize with the building as it then stood. He did not
remain to see the plans carried out, but was on his recall
to Siena remunerated with one hundred florins by the
Fabbrica (<i>Opera</i>) of Milan.</p>

<p>On October 24 of the same year, Giovanni della Rovere,
the Prefect of Rome, wrote to the Signoria of Siena praying
for the service of their architect, and on November 4,
1490, Virginio Orsino, Duke of Bracciano, begged him to
go and build a fortress at Campagnano.</p>

<p>Next Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, wanted him at the
Castle of Capua, where he went between February and May
1491, and in August of the same year the Anziani, Lords of
Lucca, petitioned for him. And so he is called from end to
end of Italy, and wherever he goes he is received with
honour as a grand architect.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232"  class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>At Orvieto we find the same preponderance of Lombards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
as in Siena. The register of the <i>Opera</i> there for August 30,
1293, gives the salaries of the <i>Magistri</i> in the Loggia
(lodge) of the Fabbrica. Here we find many of our
Sienese friends; Magistro Orlando and Guido da Como
receive six soldi a day; Magistro Martino da Como seven.
We find also Pietro Lombardo, Giacomo and Benedetto da
Como, sculptors; Martino, Guido, and Aroldo as successive
chief architects in the Fabbrica or <i>Opera</i>.</p>

<p>In 1305 the <i>camarlengo</i> had to write to Lombardy for
more builders and sculptors, for, says Della Valle, "la fama
di volo ne spargesse il grido fin oltre ai confini d'Italia,"
and in December four <i>Magistri</i> arrived&mdash;"Mag. Franciscus
Lombardus, Mag. Marchettus Lombardus, Mag. Benedictus
Lombardus, and Johannes de Mediolano (Milan)."
I do not know which of these sculptured the door of which
we give an illustration, but the artist has set the sign of
his fraternity on it in the lions beneath the pillars. (One is
now missing.)</p>

<p>The Lodge of Orvieto, sometimes spelt <i>Loya</i> or <i>Loja</i>,
is described as a large, spacious, and airy building, in which
the sculpturing of stones and marbles was done, and where
the stores and the schools were.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233"  class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The use of the word "Lodge" for this complicated
organization seems a sign of Freemasonry, and suggests
that the Comacines followed the ancient rules of Vitruvius,
and kept up the organization of the Roman <i>Collegium</i>.</p>

<p>We have, I think, proved this to be true, and shown
that the same organization held good up to the fifteenth
century, if not longer. Signor Milanesi's interesting collection
of Sienese documents, if studied closely, contains
endless indications of the existence of the guild. We find
several cases of arbitration, such as when Doctor Filippo
Francesconi, and Maestro Lorenzo di Pietro, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Vecchietta, were chosen on September 20, 1471, as
arbiters between Maestro Urbano di Pietro of Cortona,
sculptor, and Bastiano di Francesco, stone-cutter, his workman,
who lodged a complaint against his master on account
of unpaid wages and loss of tools. This same Urbano
appears to have been frequently in need of arbiters, for
on Jan. 27, 1471-72, Bertino di Gherardo was called on to
settle a cause between Madonna Caterina, wife of Silvio
Piccolomini, and the sculptor Urbano, and decided that the
lady must pay the artist 100 lire within the term of four
years, the payments to be made quarterly. It was at the
lady's option to pay in kind, such as corn or wine, if it
suited her better.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234"  class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Then there are frequent meetings of
councils for appraising the work of other Masters, and we
find the <i>Operaio</i>, or Head of Administration, fixing the
salaries of underlings. Precisely the same meetings, arbitrations,
appraisings, went on in Florence. Indeed, in the
fifteenth century the two lodges of Siena and Florence
were so closely intermingled, the Masters appearing now
in one city and then in the other, that there can be no
doubt a fraternity existed between them. We even find
Donatello, who came from Florence to make the bronze
doors, sleeping in a feather bed supplied by the <i>camarlengo</i>
of the <i>Opera</i> at Siena.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235"  class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Donatello was more or less in Siena between 1457 and
1461. He was engaged to sculpture the altar of the
Madonna of the Duomo there on October 17, 1457. His
accounts are much mixed up with those of Urbano di
Pietro of Cortona, of whom we have spoken. It seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Urbano bought the metal to cast a half figure of Judith,
and one of St. John, both modelled by Donatello. The
money, however, was advanced to Urbano by the banker
Dalgano di Giacomo Bichi. The books of the <i>camarlengo</i>
of the <i>Opera</i> have several entries for expenses of modelling
wax, and metal for casting, etc., used by Donatello in the
figures on the altar of the Madonna delle Grazie; his
assistants and pupils on this occasion were Francesco di
Andrea di Ambrogio, of Lombard origin, and Bartolommeo
di Giovanni di Ser Vincenzo.

<p>Art is like a flower. If the seeds are sown in favourable
soil the plant grows, develops, and bears beautiful
blossoms, which in their turn leave seed for future
generations. If the soil be not favourable, the plant may
perhaps reach its flowering season, but it is weak, and
the seeds lack the power of reproduction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>Thus in small cities like Modena, Parma, Orvieto, etc.,
the artistic atmosphere and soil were wanting. The
lodges of those cities never became firmly rooted. The
Lombard Masters placed there did their work, and then
moved to other cities, but the natives remained uninfluenced.
In Pisa, art first took root. The Pisans, whose artistic
faculties had been awakened by the classic spoils they had
gathered together in their conquests, found a practical
outlet for them in the teaching of the <i>laborerium</i> set up in
their midst by Buschetto and his assistants and followers.
Pisans joined the lodge, and from it great teachers arose.
Siena was the next lodge that took root, and drew native
artists into it; then followed Venice and Florence; and
through them all, distinct as they became in later times,
the seed was always sown by the Comacines or Lombard
Masters. The Campionese and Buoni families are at the
bottom of all the Tuscan schools, and every one of these
cradles of art was of the self-same form, <i>i.e.</i> composed of
the school, the <i>laborerium</i>, and the <i>Opera</i> of the Comacine
Masters.</p>

<p>And what connection had Arnolfo, the first designing
architect of the Florentine cathedral and Palazzo Vecchio,
with this Masonic company? He had much to do with
it, inasmuch as he was an hereditary member, in fact one
of the aristocracy of the guild, and he had a most complete
training in it. The first trace we get of Arnolfo is
his instruction in the school of Magister Niccolò Pisano.
The proof of this is a deed drawn up in Siena on May 11,
1266, in which these words occur&mdash;"requisivit Magistrum
Nicholam Petri de Apulia quod ipse faceret et curaret ita;
quod Arnolfus discipulus suus statim veniret Senas ad
laborandum in dicto opere, cum ipso magistro Nichola."
Here we have Niccolò di Pisa as Master in the guild, and
his disciple Arnolfo not yet having graduated.</p>

<p>Another paper relating to Niccolò's work on the pulpit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
at Siena says&mdash;"Secum ducat Senas Arnolphum et
Lapum, suos discipulos."</p>

<p>By 1277 Arnolfo seems to have graduated, for when
Niccolò and Giovanni di Pisa were at work on the beautiful
fountain at Perugia in that year, Fra Bevignate, the
<i>soprastante</i> of the work, sent to call Magister Arnolfo from
Florence to assist in the sculpture of the fountain. Arnolfo,
however, declared in a letter dated Aug. 27, 1277, that he
could not go to Perugia, or undertake any work there
without the consent of King Charles of Anjou (King of
Naples and Sicily) or of Hugo, his vicar in Rome. King
Charles was applied to, and on Sept. 10 of that year he
wrote conceding permission to Arnolfo to go and assist his
old master&mdash;then 74 years of age&mdash;and also to take the
marbles necessary.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237"  class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>These documents are very valuable apart from the fact
they chronicle. They show how the guild was not only
privileged by the reigning monarch, but that he was the
active president of it. It explains all those queer words on
Longobardic inscriptions, beginning&mdash;"In tempore Dominus
Honorius Episcopus," "In tempore præsule Paschalis, etc.,"
showing that they point out the reigning king, pope, or
patron bishop who was at the time president of the Great
Guild. The name of this highest magnate is usually
followed in these inscriptions by the Grand Master, <i>soprastante</i>
or <i>operaio</i> of the special lodge. The universality of
the guild is also shown; its president, the king, being at
Naples, his "vice" at Rome.</p>

<p>The next place in which we see Arnolfo is in Rome,
where he worked with his <i>socio</i> (fellow Freemason), Pietro,
at the tabernacle of San Paolo fuori le mura. Here, with
this ancestor of the Cosmati, Arnolfo learned his love of
polychrome sculpture, which he afterwards adapted to the
larger uses of architecture; for his grand Florentine Dome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
seems only a magnified inlaid casket. There is a beautiful
piece of inlaid work in the Opera del Duomo which I
believe to have been the <i>pluteus</i> or parapet of the tribune
in Arnolfo's time. It is in the Cosmatesque work which
Arnolfo often executed. That he was as apt a pupil of the
Cosmatesque revival of the <i>opus Alexandrinum</i> as he
had been of Niccolò's figure sculpture, and his father
Jacopo's architecture, is evident by his tomb of Cardinal de
Braye at Orvieto, where we next find him working in 1285.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238"  class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
The tomb is a beautiful mixture of Cosmatesque ornamentation
with the legitimate sculpture which he had learned
from Niccolò. The capitals of the spiral inlaid columns of
the sarcophagus are of the true old Romano-Lombard
form. In the simple grace of the recumbent figure we
descry a forerunner of Donatello and Desiderio.</p>

<p>We have now traced Arnolfo's training through three
or four of the chief lodges, and always under the best
Masters. It is then no marvel that by 1294 his fame had
risen so high that he was chosen as architect of the Duomo
of Florence. He was well known to the Florentines, his
master, Jacopo Tedesco, otherwise Lapo, having left Colle
to settle in Florence, where he was engaged to build the
Palace of the Podestà (Bargello). And this brings us to
the vexed question of the parentage of Arnolfo.</p>

<p>Vasari says that Jacopo or Lapo, whom he calls "il
Tedesco" (meaning Lombard architect), was the father of
Arnolfo, and he gives this as a certain fact, understood to
be the case by the world in general for two or three
centuries past.</p>

<p>Milanesi, on the strength of the document quoted
above, "Secum ducat Senas Arnolphum et Lapum suos
discipulos," says that Lapo was only Arnolfo's contemporary
and fellow-pupil.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_451" id="i_451"></a>
<img src="images/i_451.jpg" width="503" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Monument to Cardinal de Braye. By Magister Arnolfo.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_314">See page 314.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>But neither Vasari nor Milanesi seem to reflect that
there might have been two Lapi. Certainly, if two youths
are fellow-disciples of one Master, it is not probable that
the senior should be the son of the other. On the other
hand, if "Jacopo il Tedesco," said to be Arnolfo's father,
was elected head architect at Assisi in 1228, how could he
have been a young pupil of Niccolò di Pisa in 1266?</p>

<p>Recognizing these difficulties, Milanesi sets out in
search of a father for Arnolfo, in place of Lapo, his fellow-pupil.
He comes across a document in the archives of the
"Riformazione" of Florence, dated MCCC. Aprile 1,
where the privileges of citizenship are accorded to "Magistrum
Arnolphum de Colle, filium olim Cambij."<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"  class="fnanchor">[239]</a> In
quoting this, Gaye<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240"  class="fnanchor">[240]</a> says that in spite of it the Florentines
will persist in calling Arnolfo the son of Lapo. Now
cannot these conflicting facts be reconciled? It is a strange
fact that in no other Florentine deed except this one
privilege is any sign of parentage given to Arnolfo. He
is so enveloped in the greatness of being <i>caput magister</i>,
and the greatest architect of his day, that his parentage
seems to be lost sight of, though the universal custom of
the day was to cite the father's name as well as the son's
in a document. Therefore, though we have never before
heard the surname of Jacopo il Tedesco, there is no reason
in the world why it should not be Cambi. By the time
Arnolfo was grown up, Jacopo Tedesco had lived many
years in Florence; he therefore, having become a Florentine
citizen, may have taken office and might have been connected
with the Cambio, or Exchange there, taking his name
from that office, as a large family of Cambi during the
Republic seems to have done.</p>

<p>I incline, however, to another theory&mdash;that Cambij is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
corruption of Campij, or Campione&mdash;for the following reason&mdash;As
early as 1228 Jacopo Tedesco was already a <i>Magister</i>,
and of such fame that he was chosen as master architect of
the grand church of S. Francesco at Assisi, in conjunction
with Fra Philippus de Campello. In spite of Fergusson's
opinion that the architect of these large buildings was
generally a mere builder, working under some ecclesiastic
who drew the plan, the evidence goes to prove, in this
case, that Jacopo the layman was <i>capo maestro</i>, and Fra
Philippus the ecclesiastic only <i>aiutante</i> (assistant). Campello
was a corruption of Campiglione or Campione, which
name, first taken from a place near Como, became afterwards
the distinctive title of the Parma school of Comacine
Masters. We find it spelt in different documents: Campillio,
Campellio, Campilionum, Campione, often shortened
into Campi&#864;o or Camp&#864;i. All the older writers say that
Jacopo Tedesco was a Comacine or Lombard, and if so, he
was one of the Campionesi. His name occurs in a stipulation
made at Modena on Nov. 30, 1240, where he and
Alberto are qualified as uncles of Magister Enrico, one of
the contracting parties.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241"  class="fnanchor">[241]</a> This may well have been the
father of Arnolfo, especially as Baldinucci<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242"  class="fnanchor">[242]</a> asserts that
Jacopo Tedesco lived at Colle in Val d'Elsa, where Arnolfo
was born, while his father was building the castle there.
With these lights Milanesi's documental "Arnolphus de
Cambii" may be accounted for. If the members of the
Campione school in the north took that as their name, why
should not Jacopo also have signed himself Campione? It
is more than probable he shortened it according to custom
into Campi&#864;o, and may not have been very particular to
distinguish between the kins-letters p and b, a very common
fault in the sketchy spelling of old MSS., and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
likely to occur if, while Lombardy was a German province,
he should have imbibed a German accent. This would
reconcile all the dispute. Arnolfo was evidently closely
connected with the elder Lapo, his style being so similar.
Compare the Palazzo Vecchio and Bargello with Lapo's
castle of Poppi, and the relation is evident. His connection
with the younger Lapo is equally clear. In the list of
qualified masters in painting at Florence, quoted by Migliore
in <i>Firenze illustrata</i>, p. 414, is Niccolò Pisano's pupil, who
is called Lapo di Cambio. This would suggest that
Arnolfo and his fellow-pupil Lapo were brothers as well as
fellow-pupils, so that when Lapo the younger finished
Jacopo Tedesco's (Lapo the elder's) work at Colle, he was
only following out the usual rules of the guild, in which the
son succeeded the father.</p>

</div>

<p>The thirteenth century was a time of immense development
in art; what Niccolò and Giovanni di Pisa did for
sculpture, Jacopo Tedesco and Arnolfo did for architecture.
Jacopo was the first to introduce the pointed arch into
Central Italy, at Assisi; Arnolfo further developed it in
his cathedral at Florence, where the arches of the nave are
round, and the windows pointed. After this era we have
no more Romanesque&mdash;the reign of Italian Gothic has
begun.</p>

<p>The Basilican form, too, has vanished; we have now
the nave and transepts of the Latin cross. No longer
the small double-arched window, but long pointed arches
filled with beautiful tracery. The old symbolic animals
linger on, but in the subordinate form of grotesques in
ornamentation.</p>

<p>That distinctive mark of the guild, the lion of Judah,
takes a new position in the Italian Gothic. It is no longer
between the pillar and the arch, but beneath the column,
as Niccolò and Guido da Como first placed it in their
pulpits. You see it under the pillars of the north door of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
the Florentine Duomo, where the transition into Renaissance
is indicated by a particularly classic figure of a child standing
by the lion; and under the central column of the
windows of the Spanish chapel in the cloister of S. Maria
Novella, where it serves to mark the fact that the architects
Fra Sisto and Fra Ristoro (who in the documents of the
time are styled Magister Fra Sisto and Magister Fra
Ristoro) were members of the Masonic Guild.</p>

<p>Jacopo, the inaugurator of Italian Gothic, spent all his
later years in Florence, having left Colle many years before,
when he had finished the castle there. Jacopo's work in
Florence consisted of the building of the Bargello, which
is a perfect specimen of the late Comacine style, built in
<i>modo gallico</i> with large smoothly-hewn stones. The
connection of the Masters of the guild with the south of
Italy is shown here as well as at Pisa, for it is said that
King Manfred commissioned Jacopo Tedesco to design
the sepulchre of the Emperor Frederic in the abbey church
of Monreale in Sicily. (Manfred died in 1266.)</p>

<p>Jacopo also introduced a reform into Florence. In the
time when Messer Rubaconte of Como was Podestà of
Florence (1236, 1237), his compatriot, Jacopo Tedesco of
Campione, near Como, proposed to him that the streets
should be paved with stones instead of bricks, to which
Messer Rubaconte agreed, and the same method of paving
still continues in Florence.</p>

<p>The second Lapo, Arnolfo's fellow-pupil, and perhaps
brother, was the author of several buildings in the end of
the thirteenth century, which Vasari falsely attributes to
Jacopo the elder. He also continued Jacopo Tedesco's
fortifications at Colle.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243"  class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Whether we look on Arnolfo as the son of Jacopo
Tedesco, or only as the pupil of Niccolò Pisano, he was,
either way, one of the guild; and more, a follower of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Jacopo rather than of Niccolò, his bent being rather architectural
than sculptural. We can, then, place Arnolfo as
the first head of the <i>laborerium</i> of Florence; and in
tracing the formation of this branch of the guild, we shall
throw a light on all the former branches, which, from want
of systematic documents, have remained as formless organizations
of <i>schola</i>, <i>laborerium</i>, and <i>Opera</i>. After trying in
vain to find something more explicit about these organizations
at the National Library and State Archives, I consulted
the director of the Opera del Duomo, who kindly saved me
the work of long puzzling over old MSS., by lending me a
copy of Cesare Guasti's valuable collection of abstracts from
the books of the <i>Opera</i>, from the earliest days of Arnolfo
to the completion of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Here the whole organization stands revealed. Here are
the meetings of the lodge, and the subjects discussed; the
names of the <i>Magistri</i> and Council of Administration from
year to year; the payments to architects, artists, and men;
the legal contracts and business reports.</p>

<p>It is clearly seen how the <i>Opera</i> is connected with
the <i>laborerium</i>, and how the meetings are always composed
of some civic members from the Council of Administration,
and some from the working Masters of the lodge.</p>

<p>One, dated October 15, 1436, reports a meeting in the
Opera del Duomo, at which the attendant <i>Operai</i> or
councillors were Ugo Alessandri, Donato Velluti, Nicolo
Caroli de Macignis, and Benedict <i>Cicciaporci</i> (pig's flesh);
here's a nickname! They deliberated on the advisability
of sending for a certain Francesco Livii de Gambasso,
<i>Comitatus Florentiæ</i>, who was at Lubeck in Germany, to
make the painted windows and mosaics. Francesco, when
he came back to the city which he had known in his
boyhood, and where he had learnt his art, bound himself to
work in the <i>laborerium</i> of the <i>Opera</i>, "et in dicta civitate
Florentiæ in Laboreriis dictæ Operæ toto tempore suæ vitæ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
eidem continuum, ac firmum inviamentum exhiberent, ita, et
taliter, quod ipse una cum sua familia victum, et vestitum in
præfata Civitate erogare posset."<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244"  class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This one document gives
valuable proof on several points.</p>

<p>It proves that whether or not Italy got her architects
from Germany, Italian Masters were employed in

<p>It proves that there was a guild in Florence, "Comitatus
Florentiæ," to which Francesco Livii belonged, and
that there was a <i>laborerium</i> in Florence, in which Francesco,
when a boy, had learned his art, and risen to the rank of
Master. It proves, moreover, that the <i>laborerium</i> was
connected with the <i>Opera</i>.</p>

<p>Another meeting of the same <i>Opera</i> on November
26, 1435, held to consider all the designs for the choir of
the Duomo, marks this connection still more plainly.</p>

<p>Here follow the criticisms of this council on three designs
for the choir: one by Filippo Brunelleschi; one by Nencio
di Bartoluccio; a third by Magister Agnolo da Arezzo.</p>

<p>Observe that we have as master architects of the guild,
a monk and a hospital warden, called on the Commission
with the <i>Operai</i>, who were influential citizens, but not
qualified Masters. This seems to throw a light on the word
<i>colligantes</i>, "Magister comacinus cum colligantes suos," in
the old laws of Rotharis. Would not the <i>colligantes</i> mean
the Consuls and <i>Operai</i>, members of the <i>Opera</i> or administrative
body in these great works of church-building, whom
the <i>Magistri</i> of the guild elected from the influential men
of the city in which they were?</p>

<p>Here are a few translations of his quaint statements of
the orders the <i>Provveditore</i> received from the <i>Operai</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>June 1353.</i>&mdash;Operai: Lotto, Lapo, Piero di Cienni,
Simone di Michele Ristori. They tell me to make haste
and obtain the payments from the 'Camera' (council), and
the 'Gabelle' (octroi). I must manage that by St. John's
Day; the 'covelle' of the Campanile must be finished. And
to do that, I must get two of the <i>Magistri</i> from Or San
Michele. And the scaffolding must be taken down from S.
Giovanni (the Baptistery), so that the work may be seen."</p>

<p>This entry shows how many buildings the guild were
engaged on, and how the architects of them all were under
the command of the <i>Opera</i>, or centre of administration for
all.</p>

<p>"<i>August 14, 1353.</i>&mdash;Piero, Lotto, and Simone." (Every
entry begins by naming the <i>Operai</i> in council.) "To order
designs for a tabernacle.... Get it made. To order the
design for the campanile, and in what kind. Have it done
in wood. To order marble, for the work at the summit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
To tell Francesco<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246"  class="fnanchor">[246]</a> there is work for a year. About the
rations of Neri Fieravanti. Give him the money to pay
all the master's claims, and you, Filippo, shall be the pay-master,
and we will provide the means." ("Dalle danari
per pagare tutti i maestri loro, e tu Filippo sia loro camarlingo,
e noi ti faremo provedere.")<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247"  class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The way in which the <i>Provveditore</i>, Filippo Marsili,
talks of himself, and puts down his orders from the <i>Operai</i>
just in their own words, is naïve in the extreme. His memoranda
are certainly delightful.</p>

<p>Here is another very busy day&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>September 26, 1353.</i>&mdash;Operai: Simone, Migliorozzo,
Francescho, Piero." (This time the head architect, Francesco
Talenti, was in council.) "To elect a salaried
lawyer. About a notary for citations. About the nine
hundred and fifty lire which the Commune has of ours. To
pay by the piece, rather than by the day. To send to
Carrara (for marble). Put it off till All Saints' Day. Of
the many documents we need.... To reason with the
Regolatori.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248"  class="fnanchor">[248]</a> To speak with the captains of the Misericordia
about our many legacies.... Tell them to let us know
when they meet. About the Wills. To discuss it with
Ser Francescho Federigi (a notary). To find means to get
ready money. Try and get a discount on the tax on
assignments. About the wine for the Masters. Take it
away entirely. About Francesco and the window ... to
pay the Master who had the commission ... and when the
work is done, have it valued, and the surplus, or the deficit,
will be entered to Francesco" (head architect).</p>

<p>Truly it was no sinecure to be <i>Provveditore</i> for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
guild of architects in those days. He must have had his
hands full indeed! When the Masters were not satisfied
with their pay, and a work had to be appraised, like this
window, a special council was called, consisting of the
Consuls of the Arte della Lana, who were the Presidents of
the <i>Opera</i>, the members of the <i>Opera</i>, and all the <i>Magistri</i>
of the <i>laborerium</i>. The Masters were then called on one
by one to give an estimate of the work, and discuss its
merits; a ratio was taken, and the medium price fixed.</p>

<p>The same kind of council was called to consider any
designs. Generally, several of the <i>Magistri</i> sent in their
designs, or models made of wood. These were discussed
in council, and votes taken before the final commission was
given. The report of one of these meetings, where each
Master naïvely voted for his own design, is very amusing.</p>

<p>The Masters were strictly bound by contract to the
<i>laborerium</i>. In some cases they were paid by the day.
We find, on May 29, 1355, that the salaries of Masters were
lessened by two soldi a day, and workmen by one soldo.
Sometimes the Commune found them wine and rations; at
others they were paid by the piece, by contract. On June
7, 1456, the <i>Provveditore</i> writes&mdash;"It is desired that on no
account shall any Master go to work outside the Opera,
without the deliberation and consent of all four Operai. If
any absent himself without this permission, he shall be considered
as discharged."</p>

<p>The schools attached to the <i>laborerium</i> must have been
very complete. They trained pupils in the three sister arts&mdash;architecture,
sculpture, and painting. One sees the remains
of them in the Belle Arti at Florence, Siena, and other
towns, and the Academy of St. Luke at Rome. Not all
the <i>Magistri</i> were teachers, but there were certain of them
who held office as Professors. Niccolò di Pisa was
certainly one of these, and so were Cimabue and <i>Magister</i>
Giotto.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>This full art-education accounts for the artist of the
Renaissance being such an all-round man. One finds a
painter like Giotto, or a sculptor like Niccolò Pisano,
building grand architectural works. Sometimes they
graduated in all three arts, as did Landi, Giotto, and Leon
Battista Alberti.</p>

<p>When they graduated in the schools, they became
<i>Magistri</i> of the guild, and could then undertake commissions.
Besides the <i>Magistri fratelli</i>, there were the
undergraduates as it were; in old Latin documents they
are written as <i>fratres</i>; below these were the novices or
pupils. The workmen employed by them were quite
unconnected with the guild, and were paid daily wages as
manual labourers.</p>

<p>The light thus thrown on the organization of the
Masonic Guild by the valuable collection of documents
made by Cesare Guasti, seems to me to explain much that
was puzzling in the Florentine city guilds. For instance,
why, among all the <i>Arti</i>, is there none which includes
architects, sculptors, or painters? It would have been
supposed that in the early days of the republic, when the
Commune spent its wealth and enthusiasm on erecting
great and noble buildings, architecture would certainly have
ranked among the greater <i>Arti</i>, even in competition with
the wool-combers and silk-weavers. But there was no
such civic guild. There was a minor one for masons and
stone-cutters, but it was established later for workmen and
mere house-builders, and had nothing to do with great
architects or master sculptors; while painters who wished
to be members of the Commune and have any hand in the
government, had to enroll themselves in the Goldsmith
Guild, or the "Arte degli speziali" (doctors and apothecaries).
The existence of this Freemasonic Guild would
explain this hiatus in the greater arts. While such a
powerful and self-governing body existed, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
evidently the monopoly for Italy in the art of church-building,
a mere city guild would never have been able to
compete with it, and would have been superfluous.</p>

<p>That it really held the monopoly is more than probable.
We have traced the Comacines through each gradation, have
seen the successive schools and branches started by them in
each place where they had great works in hand. The
Buoni family at Modena going on to the south of Italy
and then to Pistoja, founded that school. The Campione
branch at Verona and Parma hence passed to Assisi and
Florence. The Lucca school of Lombard Masters spread
to Pisa and gathered into it native talent.</p>

<p>The later gathering of Lombards and Pisans at Siena
thence moved to Orvieto, and sent a branch to Florence in
the persons of Jacopo Tedesco and Arnolfo. There taking
root it grew into the goodly flower of the Renaissance.
And after efflorescence,&mdash;decay; the old organization, by
degrees, dissolved in the greater freedom of art. Each
Master aimed to stand alone on his own merits, and was
no longer necessarily enrolled as one in a guild.</p>

<p>A great many things besides are revealed to us by
Guasti's collection of documents. We find that Arnolfo died
in 1310; Vasari read it wrongly as 1300, so that Arnolfo
would only have worked a year or two at his Duomo. The
correct entry in the archives is&mdash;"IIII idus (martii) Quiescit
magister Arnolfus de l'opera di Santa Reparata MCCCX."<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249"  class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>It is a strange coincidence that the death registered
before Arnolfo in the Necrology should be a man named
Cambio, a locksmith, but he seems to have no connection
with Arnolfo, whose parentage as usual is not indicated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we see that Arnolfo at the most only worked
eleven or twelve years at a building which took more than
a century to finish. How much did he accomplish?
Probably not more than the foundations and the design
which he left, and which may be seen to this day; for it is
usually understood that the church in the fresco of the
Spanish chapel represents the Duomo as Arnolfo designed
it. After his death Florence fell upon warlike times, and
was unable to continue the work till 1331, when the "city
being in a happy and tranquil state, recommenced the
building of the church of Santa Reparata, which had for
a long time been in abeyance, and had made no progress,
owing to the many wars and expenses which the city
had undergone." The deed goes on to relate that the
Arte della Lana was placed at the head of the administration,
and that a tax of two denari per libbra on all
moneys paid to the Commune should be appropriated
for the expense, as had been decreed before. They
further added another tax on the customs, so that the
two amounted to 12,000 <i>libbre picciole</i> a year. Besides
this, every shop in Florence was to have a money-box
where they were to place <i>il denaro di Dio</i> (tithes) on all
they sold.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250"  class="fnanchor">[250]</a> I quote this to show how cities in the good old
church-building days paid their architects. It is probable
that the schools of the guild had continued in this interval,
though the <i>Magistri</i> may have had to seek work elsewhere,
for by July 18, 1334, we find Giotto as a <i>Magister</i>, selected
as architect of the Campanile, though he seems to have had
very little to do with the Duomo. His marvellous tower,
in its varied colouring and artistic effect, shows the hand of
a painter rather than an architect. He did not live to see
his work completed, for on January 8, 1336, he died, soon
after his return from Milan, where he had been sent in the
services of the Visconti, and had a public funeral at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
expense of the Commune in Santa Reparata. The fact that
the work of his tower went on in his absence, proves that he
must have had brethren in the guild capable of carrying out
his plans. As the foundations were only laid in July 1334,
and Giotto died in January 1336, after a long absence at
Milan, one wonders how he found time to sculpture the
reliefs in his Hymn of Labour. However, we must take
Ghiberti's testimony for it. In his second <i>Commentary</i>,
Ghiberti says<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"  class="fnanchor">[251]</a>&mdash;"The first line of reliefs which are in the
Campanile which he erected were sculptured and designed
by his own hand. In my time I have seen his own sketches
beautifully drawn." A contemporary anonymous commentator
on Dante writes<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252"  class="fnanchor">[252]</a>&mdash;"Giotto designed and superintended
the marble bell-tower of Santa Reparata in Florence,
a notable tower and costly. He committed two errors&mdash;one
that it had no base, and the other that it was too
narrow. This caused him such grief that, they say, he
fell ill and died of it." I think indeed that if Giotto
had found any error he would have rectified it in the
plans which he left for his successors. That it had
no foothold is not true, for the solid foundation was
placed so far beneath the surface that it stood firm on
the solid <i>macigno</i> (kind of granite rock) twenty <i>braccia</i>
below.</p>

<p>His successor was of another branch of the guild, but a
Masonic <i>Magister</i> all the same. On April 26, 1340, Andrea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
di Pisa was elected by vote by the Council of the <i>Opera</i> to
succeed Giotto as head architect.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253"  class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>There must have been other <i>Magistri</i> proposed as
candidates, if the Council had to resort to black and white
beans for the voting. Andrea only lived a few years; he
died, or retired from office, in 1348, the year of the great
plague; and Francesco Talenti became <i>caput Magister</i> in
1350. Francesco was a brother of Fra Jacopo Talenti,
<i>Magister lapidum et edificorum</i>, who was joint architect with
Fra Ristoro of the convent and church of Santa Maria
Novella from 1339 to 1362. Francesco, like his brother,
must have been in the guild; he worked at Orvieto
cathedral among numbers of Como and Lombard Masters
in 1329. In April 1336 we find him called to Siena as
an expert.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254"  class="fnanchor">[254]</a> There had been discovered some defect in
the columns. Francesco's companion from Florence was
Benci di Cione. His office as <i>capo maestro</i> of the Duomo
of Florence continued some years, though he did not reign
alone, but was associated with Giovanni di Lapo Ghino,
who after 1360 is called joint <i>capo maestro</i>. The principal
documents of their administration prove that there were
endless councils and arguments about the size, height,
and placing of the columns, and discussions on Talenti's
plan for the chapels at the east end. This seems to
have been a crucial question.... Councils of four
<i>Magistri</i> in each were held for three consecutive days&mdash;July
15, 16, and 17, 1355; and their opinions given in
writing. On August 5 the grand united council of twelve
Masters and the whole lodge was held, when the proportions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
for the columns were decided, and Francesco's design
for the chapel approved.</p>

<p>Another Council was held on June 8, 1357, with the
<i>Operai</i> and Consuls of Arts, and their ecclesiastical
colleagues, when the undermentioned Masters and monks
gave their counsel on the church&mdash;a proof of the close
affinity of ecclesiastics with the Masonic Guild.</p>

<li>Magister Ambrogio Lenzi, or Renzi</li>
</ul>
<p>The report was written by Sig. Mino, notary of the
guild; the spelling of the names is his own.</p>

<p>Several of the same monks met at the <i>Opera</i> on July 12,
1357, to consult about the placing of the columns in the
second foundation.</p>

<p>Also, on July 17, 1357, to choose between two designs
of columns and a chapel made by Francesco Talenti and
Orcagna, when each candidate elected two Masters as
arbiters. Francesco Talenti chose Ambrogio Lenzi, a
Lombard, and Frate Filippo Riniero of S. Croce. Andrea
Orcagna chose Niccolò di Beltramo, also a Lombard,
and Francesco di Neri. These could not decide, and Piero
di Migliore the goldsmith was taken as umpire, the parties
binding themselves to abide by his decision. Giovanni di
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Lapo Ghino and Francesco Talenti were ordered to make
new designs. At length, on July 28, Orcagna's plan was
chosen.</p>

<p>Talenti's office was no sinecure; we often find him
disputing with other Masters. Indeed, the lodge greatly
lacked unity. Disintegration was beginning. On August
5, 1353, the <i>Provveditore</i>, Filippo Marsili, writes&mdash;"I must
get Neri di Fioravanti and Francesco Talenti to settle that
dispute within fifteen days. They must choose an arbiter
each, and may elect the third arbiter by joint consent."
They chose Benozzi as mutual third. Again on October
4, 1353&mdash;"The Master who executes Francesco Talenti's
design for the window must be paid his demands. When
the work is done, have it valued, and the balance more or
less to go to Francesco's account."</p>

<p>He seems also to have been an improvident sort of man.
Here are two tell-tale entries in Filippo Marsili's memorandum
book&mdash;"July 12, 1353. Advance him as soon as convenient
the pay for four months. Take it out, by deducting
half his salary weekly." Again in November the
entry is&mdash;"Lend him what he wants."</p>

<p>In 1376 Francesco's son Simone became joint <i>capo
maestro</i> with Benci Cione, Orcagna's father, at a salary of
eight gold florins a month. Simone graduated also in the
sculpture school, and executed a figure for the façade, for
which he was paid thirteen florins on September 4, 1377.
Zanobi Bartoli, also a <i>Magister lapidum</i> (sculptor), was at
the same time paid twenty gold florins each for two marble
figures, though he received only eighteen florins for his
statue of the Archangel Michael in December of the same
year.</p>

<p>Francesco's colleague, Giovanni di Lapo Ghino, is a good
instance&mdash;one of many&mdash;of the hereditary nature of the
guild. We first hear of Ghino at Siena in the thirteenth
century. On February 7, 1332, his sons Simone and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Jacopo, or Lapo di Ghino, sign a contract with Agostino and
his son Giovanni of Siena, to build a chapel in the Pieve S.
Maria at Arezzo&mdash;that of Bishop Tarlati, Bindo de' Vanni
and his son Francesco, with two other <i>Magistri</i>, being
witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255"  class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>In 1362 a certain Ambrosius Ghino is named in a list of
the lodge. He may have been a brother or nephew of Lapo.
Then comes the third generation, and we find Giovanni, son
of Lapo di Ghino, at Orvieto. He afterwards came to
Florence, where he was elected <i>capo maestro</i>, at first in
unison with Jacopo Talenti, and later by himself. In 1388
old Ghino's great-grandson, whose whole pedigree is given
in the books as "Michele, Johannis, Lapi, Ghini," became
in his turn <i>capo maestro</i> of the Duomo of Florence. His
descendant, Antonio Ghino, also graduated in the Florentine
Lodge, but he went back to Siena, where he appears as one
of the <i>Magistri</i> employed there in 1472.</p>

<p>This family is only one of many hereditary Masonic
brethren. The Cione family is another instance. The first
Masters of the name appear in Florence on July 1355, as
Ristoro and Benci Cione, two members attending the Council
on Francesco Talenti's design for the chapels, but whether
they were brothers or father and son I cannot tell; I presume
brothers, or Benci would have been written down as Benci
Ristori di Cione.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"  class="fnanchor">[256]</a> We have seen Benci Cione called to
Siena as an arbiter. He was much occupied in Florence,
where he worked at the building, or rather adaptation, of Or
San Michele. He and Laurentius Filippi (Lorenzo, son of
Filippo Talenti) were joint architects of the Loggia dei
Lanzi, Lorenzo superintending the sculpture, and Cione the
architecture. Lorenzo has set the sign of the guild on the
base of his columns by surrounding them with small pillars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
on which lions are crouching; the proportions and ornamentation
of the building are beautiful. Orcagna has
always been credited as the architect of this Loggia, but
he is here proved not to be the original designer, though
he probably worked with his father.</p>

<p>Orcagna's name, Andrea di Cione, first appears in the
great Council with monks and <i>Magistri</i>, held on June 18,
1357, to decide on the space which should be left between
the columns of the Duomo.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257"  class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Andrea's nickname of Orcagna, a corruption of Arcangelo
(Archangel), has clung to him through centuries, and over-shadowed
his real patronymic of Cione. The relation
between him and Benci di Cione remains rather obscure.
Orcagna has also had the credit of building the church of Or
San Michele. Probably writers confuse Orcagna, or Andrea
di Cione, the sculptor of the beautiful shrine in that church,
which is his masterpiece, with the Benci di Cione who was
architect of the building. From the close connection of the
two in the guild, and from Orcagna having worked so much
with Benci, I think it probable they were father and son.
Milanesi is rather uncertain about the father of Orcagna,
and in the genealogical table at the end of his life he writes
him as Cione with a note of interrogation, and no Christian
name, which may well have been Benci.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_473" id="i_473"></a>
<img src="images/i_473.jpg" width="352" height="551" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Shrine in Or San Michele, Florence. Designed by "Orcagna" (Andrea Cione).</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_333">See page 333.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Orcagna first studied painting under his elder brother
Nardo (short for Bernardo), who was enrolled in the
"company of St. Luke." But this was only one branch of
Andrea's art-education. He matriculated in the Masonic
Guild (<i>Arte dei maestri di pietra e legname</i>), in the books
of which it is written&mdash;"Andrea Cioni, called Archangel,
a painter of the parish of S. Michele Visdomini, took
his oath and promises in the said guild, Magister Neri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Fioravanti being his sponsor, in 1352, sixth indication,
October 29."<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258"  class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>It was Orcagna's way to emphasize his varied qualifications
by signing his paintings, "Andrea di Cione, scultore,"
and his sculptures, "Andrea di Cione, pittore." On his
masterpiece, the shrine in Or San Michele, he has inscribed,
"Andreas Cionis, pictor Florentinus, oratorii arch magister
extitit hujus MCCCLIX." The expression "Archmagister
of the Oratory" (or shrine) explains many things. It tells
us that the whole of that complicated piece of sculpture,
though it may have been designed entirely by Orcagna, was
not entirely executed by him, but that, like other <i>Magistri</i>,
he had a band of brethren working under him; for how
could he have been <i>chief</i> Master where there were no
lesser ones under his command?</p>

<p>It is interesting in studying the working of the Masonic
Guild, of which Orcagna signs himself Archmagister, to see
how they are occupied in building several grand edifices at
once. The immense number of Masters congregated in the
Florentine Lodge rendered this possible, and wealth was
not lacking in the city to employ them.</p>

<p>The books at the <i>Opera</i> reveal how the Council of
Administration dominates the <i>laborerium</i>. We shall see
how the busy <i>Provveditore</i> has to change the <i>Magistri</i> about
from Santa Croce to Or San Michele; or from the Duomo
to San Michele Visdomini, just as need presses. He has to
order marbles for all and any of these edifices; to call
councils to consider designs for all kinds of different buildings
and parts of buildings, such as windows, chapels, doors,
etc. Sometimes we find him commissioning a certain
architect to make a plan for a chapel, or a door, or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
window. When Talenti and Giovanni Ghino had both
made designs for the tribune in October 1367, the usual
councils were not enough to decide the momentous question
which to choose. The whole city had to be called into
council, together with the monks (<i>frati colleganti</i>), the
<i>Magistri</i> of the guild, etc. Hundreds and thousands of
people came to the <i>Opera</i>, looked at the designs, signed
their names on the list of approval, for one or the other.</p>

<p>After the joint reign as <i>capi maestri</i> of Giovanni di
Lapo Ghino and Francesco Talenti, came a varied line
of master builders lasting for a hundred years, so that it
is impossible to say that any one man was the architect of
the Duomo. Between Arnolfo's first plan and the final
Italian Gothic development of the fifteenth century lies the
whole history of the development of art.</p>

<p>The next great <i>capo maestro</i> after Talenti was Ambrogio
of Lenzo or Lanzo, near Como, one of the Campione
school. His name is given in a deed of February 3, 1363,
as "Ambroxius filius magistri Guglielmi de Champiglione."
It is remarkable that an ancestor and namesake of this
"Ambroxius" was also written down as "filius Magistri
Guglielmi" in 1130, two centuries earlier, when they were
leading members of the Campione school at Modena, and
sculptured the façades of Modena and Ferrara cathedrals;
so our Ambrogio of Florence was one of the distinguished
aristocracy of the lodge, his family dating from its cradle
in Lombardy. From the deed which we quote we find that
Ambrogio graduated under his father, and made his first
contract with Barna Batis, then <i>Provveditore</i> of the <i>Opera</i>
of the Duomo, to provide and prepare the black marble
necessary to the work, for every <i>braccio</i> of which he was
to be paid six soldi eight denari. This is the original&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Ambrogio or Ambrose remained many years in Florence.
His name often appears in council. In 1356 he was elected
head architect of the Duomo, and also of the restorations
at the Baptistery. On April 4, 1384, when as an old man
he attended a meeting to decide whether the pilasters of
the tribune were strong enough to support the dome, his
name is given as Ambrogio de Renzo. A marked instance
of the effect of twenty years among Florentine dialect,
which has an inveterate habit of mixing up l's and r's. His
son, Giovanni d'Ambrogio di Lenzo, who afterwards became
<i>capo maestro</i>, was also in council, and Orcagna was chosen
umpire.</p>

<p>But between the reign of Ambrogio and that of his
son we have various changes in the directorship. In 1381,
Giovanni, son of Stefano, called Guazetta, became <i>capo
maestro</i> together with Giovanni Fetti, who was also of the
guild, and preparing first in Siena, and next at Florence,
for his future work in Lucca and Bologna. Giovanni
Fetti designed and made the fine "window towards the
houses of the Cornacchini, under the third arch of the
nave."</p>

<p>Guazetta's peculiar line was laying foundations and
devising complicated scaffolding. He also made the presses
of the sacristy. He was perhaps not enough of a builder
to hold the office of chief, for in 1375 this pair resigned
in favour of Francesco Salvetti and Taddeo Ristori.
Salvetti, however, very soon renounced office, preferring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
remain in the guild on a simple salary, rather than incur
responsibilities.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259"  class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Then Francesco Talenti's son Simone, who had by this
time become a <i>Magister</i>, was put in his place with Taddeo
Ristori. Their reign lasted till 1388, when Michele, son
of Giovanni, son of Lapo, son of Ghino, was elected. In
his time the pilasters of the tribune were begun.</p>

<p>In 1404 Ambrogio's son Giovanni was elected <i>capo
maestro</i>. Here is the part of the entry of the <i>Deliberation</i>,
November 17, 1404&mdash;"Operaris ... elegerunt et nominaverunt
et deputaverunt in caput magister dicte opere Sancte
Reparata providum virum Johannem Ambroxii, etc. etc.,
cum salario florenum otto, pro quolibet mense cum auctoritate,
balia et potestate usitate et consueta."&mdash;<i>Delib.</i> xlix. 28.</p>

<p>Another deliberation, dated June 17, 1415, states that
"Johannem Ambroxii caput magister" shall give the order
for the species and form of the bricks for some special
part.</p>

<p>Giovanni, the last of the Campione school whom we
can register, was deposed for old age, and Baptista
Antoni elected in his stead. He was probably the son
of Antonio, the Grand Master mentioned above.</p>

<p>Giovanni had not always time to carry out his own
designs. In 1408 we find that Magister Niccolao, surnamed
Pela, took the contract to carve in marble the doorway
near the chapel of the crucifix, which was designed by
"Johannem Ambroxii, caput magistrum." It is rich with
vines and other ornaments. Niccolao did not push the
work, however, and in May 1408 the <i>Opera</i> decided that
he owed the guild the sum of twenty-five florins for
breaking his contract.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>The number of different minds each leading the works
in his own department is bewildering. The beautiful door
called the Mandorla, so rich and elegant in sculpture,
which is often said to have been executed by Jacopo della
Quercia, was in reality the work of Nanni di Antonio di
Banco. The books of the <i>Opera</i> register, on June 28, 1418,
a payment of twenty florins on account to Nanni for this
doorway, and in 1421 the last payment was made on the
completion of the work. Nanni was a favourite scholar of
Donatello; he was a person of good birth, who matriculated
in the <i>Arte dei Maestri di Pietra</i> on February 2, 1405, and
proved his membership by sculpturing the four patron saints
of the Masonic Guild on Or San Michele.</p>

<p>We further find in this precious collection of documents
that Magister Jacopo di Lapo Cavacciani made a model
for a shaft; that Nato di Cenni and Jacopo di Polo were,
in August 1357, engaged to make the bases of the columns,
and that time after time different Masters were called on to
make plans for chapels, windows, doors, etc.</p>

<p>Now we know the state of the building as it stood in
this fourteenth century, we realize that it was not left for
centuries without a dome. The old chronicler Buoninsegni,
in his <i>Storia Florentina</i>, lib. iv. p. 642, says&mdash;"A di venti
di giugno 1380 si cominciarono a riempire et murare i
fondamenti della cupola di S. Maria del Fiore." Up till
this time the nave only seems to have been built.</p>

<p>On August 7 a meeting of <i>Magistri</i> was called to consult
on the foundation for the cupola, and on November 12,
1380, there is a long document commissioning "Bartolommeus
Stefani, Johannes Mercati, and Leonardus Cecchii,
Magistri Florentini," to build the pilasters to support the
dome, which are to be of good stone and cement, and the
builders are cautioned not to work in times of frost or snow,
etc. etc. These pilasters caused much anxiety in the
guild; in 1384 constant meetings were held about them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
The Masters were afraid the foundations of the one towards
Via dei Servi were not firm; day after day in July 1384
they met in scores to examine and report on it. Then they
called in the consuls of the <i>Art of Wool</i>, the <i>Operai</i>, and
all the chief men of the city; and everybody, excepting a
certain Messer Biagio Guasconi (who after all was not an
architect), agreed that the foundation of the pilaster was
perfectly safe. However, good Messer Biagio still held his
own opinion and refused to sign approval.</p>

<p>From the steady way in which the work went on, it is
certainly possible and probable that there would in the
natural course of the work have been a dome to the
cathedral even without Filippo Brunelleschi. It was in the
original plan, and the foundations and pilasters were placed
in readiness for it. There was much talk of the difficulty
of placing the framework of the scaffolding for it, but there
seems to have been no doubt that it would be accomplished.
In fact numbers of the Masters sent in plans for it at
different times.</p>

<p>The first time that Brunellesco appears in the records
is at a meeting of consuls, <i>Opera</i>, and Masters, convened on
November 10, 1404, to consider a certain error in measurement
committed by the <i>capo maestro</i>, Giovanni di Ambrogio.
The question turned on the placing of the (<i>sprone</i>) brackets
on the façade which interfered with the windows.</p>

<p>It does not seem that Brunellesco belonged to the
brotherhood. He is merely mentioned as Filippo the
goldworker, son of the notary Brunelleschi (<i>Filippus ser
Brunelleschi aurifex</i>). In no place, either here or elsewhere,
is he ever called <i>Magister</i>, and throughout his life
his every action was a protest against what he called
"the <i>Maestranze</i>" a term of contempt like "their Master-ships,"
which Brunelleschi applied to the <i>Arte dei Maestri</i>.
He had matriculated in 1398, when twenty-one years
old, in the <i>Arte della Seta</i>, but as his tastes were strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
artistic, and he refused to follow his father's profession
of lawyer, he enrolled himself in 1404 in the <i>Arte degli
Orafi</i> (goldsmiths), in which so many painters were
already eminent. The goldsmiths or metal-sculptors, who
seem to have seceded from the Freemasons, were still in
some measure colleagues of the Masonic Guild, and their
members were often called to vote or advise in the councils
of the <i>Opera</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we find Brunellesco as one of the <i>orafi</i> called into
council about the construction of the brackets. He appears
to have held office as councillor in the <i>Opera</i> for a year
till 1405, when he was paid off. He was probably one of
the <i>Operai</i> on the part of the city.</p>

<p>When in the famous competition of 1402 Brunellesco
lost the commission for the doors of the Baptistery, he left
Florence in dudgeon, and with his friend Donatello went
to Rome. His studies of the methods of the ancient
Romans in making their great domes, suggested to him a
way of vindicating his <i>amour propre</i> by defeating the whole
guild of "Masters" on their own ground. He had made
architecture a special study, and now thoroughly investigated
the classic methods. He got to the roof of the
Pantheon, and made studies of the stone-work in the ribs
of the cupola, investigated the foundations, the supports,
etc., and came back to Florence, where he let drop
mysterious hints among the influential members of his own
trade company, and in the studios of one or two artists,
that even if the "<i>maestranze</i> were to call their Masters from
France or Germany, and all parts of the world, none of
them would be able to make a dome equal to the one he
could make." The Masters of the <i>laborerium</i> at length
heard of these assertions, and called on him to show his
plans, which he declined to do.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Opera</i>, on August 19, 1418, announced a
competition. Any artist whatsoever who had made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
model of the projected cupola was to produce it, before the
end of September, the model accepted to have a prize of
200 gold florins. The date of decision was prolonged to
October, and then to December, when a number of models
were sent in, the competitors being Magister Giovanni
di Ambrogio, C.M. of the <i>laborerium</i>, Manno di Benincasa,
Matteo di Leonardo, Vito da Pisa, Lorenzo Ghiberti,
all <i>Magistri</i> of the Masonic Guild; Piero d'Antonio, nicknamed
Fannulla (do nothing), Piero di Santa Maria in
Monte, masters in wood. There were several models by
members of the civic company, the <i>Arte dei Scarpellini</i>
(stone-cutters); and last, not least, a model in brick and
mortar without scaffolding, made by Brunellesco, Donatello,
and Nanni di Banco,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"  class="fnanchor">[260]</a> so he was obliged after all
to show his design. This last won the prize, but the
<i>Arte dei Maestri</i> had not evidently faith enough in one
outside their ranks to commence at once with the building.
In Signor Cesare Guasti's collection of archivial documents
regarding the building of the Duomo, we find
that from October to December 23, 1418, several of
the Masters, including Magistro Aliosso, Mag. Andrea
Berti Martignoni, Mag. Paolo Bonaiuti, Cristofero di
Simoni, and Giovanni Tuccio, were receiving payment
for building a model in masonry of Brunellesco's plan for
the cupola. I do not find that Brunellesco himself was
employed in this, the only payment to him being "50 lib.
15 soldi" for his work on the lantern of the model, between
July 11 and August 12, 1419; proving that he put the
finishing touch, but that the Masters of the guild themselves
tested his design for the great dome before finally
adopting it. This brick model, which was built on the
Piazza del Duomo, remained there till 1430, when the
<i>Opera</i> ordered its destruction. Guasti<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"  class="fnanchor">[261]</a> gives in full this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
order, which is dated January 23, 1430, and is in the usual
low Latin of contemporary documents. When the model
was finished, the <i>Magistri</i> of the guild assembled on May
14, 1421, to hold council on it. There are entries of
expenses for a breakfast to the Masters, and for torch-bearers
to accompany them on their internal investigations.
We find the same ceremony of refreshment to the <i>Magistri</i>
who visited the works of the real cupola in 1424, when six
flasks of Trebbiano (the best Tuscan wine) with fruit and
bread were provided. In 1420 Brunellesco was definitely
commissioned to superintend the cupola, but even then
the <i>Magistri</i> could not admit an outsider to full Masonic
privileges. He was not named <i>caput magister</i>, as one of
the guild would have been, but he and Ghiberti (whose
model had been next best) were named <i>provisori</i> of the
dome, while the Magister Baptista di Antonio was <i>caput
magister</i> proper of the lodge. The terms of the contract
were that "the <i>provisori</i> were to superintend the works,
providing, ordering, building, and causing to build, the
cupola from beginning to end, etc. etc."</p>

<p>At first both Ghiberti and Brunellesco drew three florins
a month. The head <i>Magister</i>, Baptista, had the usual
salary of the guild as head master.</p>

<p>The story of Brunellesco's restiveness at his old rival
Ghiberti being associated with him in carrying out a design
peculiarly his own, and how he tried to throw scorn on him,
by locking up his plans and feigning illness, thus leaving
Ghiberti to work in the dark, is too well known to need repetition
here.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262"  class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Perkins<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263"  class="fnanchor">[263]</a> is very hard on Ghiberti's ignorance,
which, he asserts, was so great that he was obliged to resign
because he could not do the work. But there are two sides
to every question. How could a man carry out a work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
designed and begun by another without seeing his plans?
Besides, Ghiberti's resignation, or rather relinquishment of
his work at the cupola just then, was, I believe, due to the
fact that he had a few months before received a commission
for the second bronze gates of the Baptistery, and
wanted his time free for them. This commission is dated
January 2, 1425. His salary as <i>provisore</i> of the cupola
ceased for a few months from June 28, 1425. The dates
speak for themselves. He still, however, held office, or
returned to it with partial pay, for in 1428 we find a decree
of the <i>Opera</i> which raises the salary of Brunellesco to 100
gold florins a year, while Ghiberti only draws his usual
three florins a month. But even then not an order is ever
given in Brunellesco's own name; every document and
every receipt was signed by Baptista d'Antonio, <i>caput
magister</i>, and Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, <i>provisore</i>.</p>

<p>And now let us see who were the underlings employed
by Brunellesco. Finding the workmen of the Florentine
Lodge were disaffected, he got ten Lombards, and shut out
all the Florentines, till they humbly came back, begging
to be taken on again, which he did at a lower salary than
before.</p>

<p>The Lombard element was still strong in the guild. A
certain <i>Maestro di legno</i>, named Magister Antonio of
Vercelli, invented a convenient mode of drawing up weights
into the cupola. The workmen had a kitchen and eating-house
up in the dome, so that they did not need to descend
in the middle of the day. In fact the <i>Opera</i> made strict
laws about this.</p>

<p>In 1436 another competition of models for the lantern
was proclaimed, and again Brunellesco won the palm
against Ghiberti and others. It seems that when the commission
was given to Brunellesco, the Masonic Guild must
have felt it <i>infra dig.</i> to make a non-member <i>capo maestro</i>
of the dome. Consequently they matriculated him into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
the fraternity. But with his jealousy of the <i>maestranze</i> and
determination to show that one need not be a Freemason
to build a church, he ignored this membership and never
paid his fees, on which the Masters of the <i>laborerium</i> sued
him for debt, and he was imprisoned. This did not suit
the City Patrons of the <i>Opera</i>, who were the all-powerful
<i>Arte della Lana</i>, especially as Brunellesco's <i>Arte della Seta</i>
was also on his side. A stormy meeting was held in the
<i>Opera</i> on August 20, 1434, at which the civic party was too
strong for the <i>Maestri</i>. It was decreed that Brunellesco
should be liberated, and one of the <i>Arte dei Maestri</i> was
imprisoned, on the plea of hindering public works!<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"  class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>After this triumph of independent architecture Brunellesco
became in a manner architect in chief to the city.
He built the pretty Loggie of the Foundling Hospital on
Piazza della SS. Annunziata, and the Pazzi Chapel at Sta.
Croce, both of which Luca della Robbia adorned with his
beautiful blue and white reliefs. He erected the fine
Palazzo Quaratesi on Piazza Ognissanti, and the remarkably
grand church of Santo Spirito was after his death
built from his designs.</p>

<p>Brunellesco's strike for independence appears to have
given the death-blow to the great Masonic Guild which, as
it became more unwieldy, had been slowly disintegrating.
The local members in large cities like Siena and Florence,
becoming too strong for the original Lombard element, had
asserted their independence by forming other guilds of a
local nature, in which even the ancient quartette of patron
saints was forgotten. How long the lodge in Florence
kept together after Brunellesco's defiance I do not know,
though its educative influence certainly lingered on till
Michael Angelo's time, he being as all-round an artist as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
any <i>Magister</i> of older days who could build a church and
decorate it too.</p>

<p>The <i>laborerium</i> of the Florentine <i>Opera</i> must, however,
have been closed by the time of Michael Angelo; for
Lorenzo de' Medici had to supplement it by giving up his
garden in the Via Larga as a school of sculpture, there
being then no place where the art was taught. His teaching,
however, was a heritage from the ancient guild, for old
Bertoldo, scholar of Donatello, was the Master there, and
the works of the Masonic Brotherhood for two centuries,
together with the classic treasures collected by the Medici,
were his models.

<p class="center p4"><span class="smcap">I.&mdash;The Comacines under the Visconti</span></p>

<p>History repeats itself. We began the story of the
Comacines in Lombardy with their works under the invading
Longobards, we end it with their works under the
usurping Visconti. The first era shows their early Roman-Lombard
style in its purity; the last shows the culmination
of their later Italian-Gothic style in its fulness.</p>

<p>Like Florence, Siena, Pisa, Pistoja, and other cities,
Milan, on freeing herself from Longobard and French
tyrants, had become a commune, but she could not escape
the usual fate of a mediæval commune, <i>i.e.</i> party faction,
and the supremacy of a dominant family. As Florence had
her Guelphs and Ghibellines, Pistoja her Bianchi and Neri,
so Milan had her two warring families, the Torriani and
Visconti. The conflict was long, but in the end the
Visconti dominated. Matteo I. reigned over Cremona,
Lodi, Bergamo, Pavia, Alexandria, and Vercelli. Azzo
Visconti subjugated Piacenza and Como, etc. Luchino
added Asti, Bobbio, and Parma; while his brother, the
Archbishop Giovanni, acquired Brescia, Genoa, and Bologna.
His nephews, Bernabò and Galeazzo II., divided the state,
and lost part of it. Genoa freed herself from Galeazzo,
while Bernabò's vices and cruelties caused rebellion everywhere.</p>

<p>Galeazzo's son, Gian Galeazzo, who was only fifteen
when his father died in 1378, married Isabella of France,
he being then seventeen, and she a child still. By this
he gained, as his bride's portion, the estate of Vertus in
Champagne, and his descendants kept up the title, which
became Italianized into Conte di Virtù. His second wife
was his cousin, Caterina, daughter of Bernabò. To assure
himself of her heritage, he imprisoned his uncle in the castle
of Trezza, where he died a few months after, some say by
poison. However this be, Gian Galeazzo immediately rode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
into Milan, where he was proclaimed Signore of Milan.
Wenceslaus, Emperor of Germany, had already created
him his Vicar-general in Lombardy, so that his power was
great. So great was it that he was able to oust the Scaligers
from Verona in 1386; the Carraresi from Vicenza and Padua
in 1387. In 1395 he induced Wenceslaus to nominate him
Duke of Milan, and to make the title hereditary. Then,
emulating his Longobardic predecessors, he began a march
of conquest southwards; took Perugia, Spoleto, and Assisi in
1400; Lucca in 1401; then he bought Pisa from the
Appiani, and Siena capitulated. Florence was next in his
list, but luckily for her he died at this juncture, and
Florence escaped.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265"  class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>These were the princes under whose auspices the
cathedral of Milan arose, a mountain of sculpture white
as snow. In olden times there were twin churches standing
on the site of Milan cathedral: S. Maria Maggiore, the
winter church, and S. Thecla, the <i>estiva</i>, or summer church.
Santa Maria had two Baptisteries, one for male children,
the other for female. They both had marvellous towers:
that of S. Maria was two hundred and forty-five <i>braccia</i>
(about four hundred and seventy feet) high, and of "admirable
beauty." This tower was thrown down and the church
destroyed in the siege of Milan, 1162. After the Peace
of Costanza, Sta. Maria was restored by public offerings,
and the Milanese ladies, like the ancient Roman dames,
threw their jewels into the treasury. The façade of this
restoration was of black and white marble in squares, and
the church was so large that it could contain 7000 people.</p>

<p>By the fourteenth century Milan had become so
wealthy and powerful that it determined to build a church
more beautiful than any before it. To Gian Galeazzo is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
generally given the whole credit of this initiative, but
documents seem to prove it was a general move on the
people's part. On May 12, 1386, Monsignor Antonio dei
Marchesi, Archbishop of Milan, addressed a circular letter
to his clergy, saying that the church of the Blessed Virgin
was old and dilapidated, and "the hearts of the faithful"
intended to rebuild it, which work being very costly, the
Archbishop prayed all his clergy to "institute offerings in
their churches, and to pray God to bless the work."</p>

<p>Again a year later he circulated another letter, to ask
that all the offerings thus gathered should be transmitted
to Milan before the <i>fête</i> of St. Martin, as the faithful were
anxious to continue the work begun. Gian Galeazzo did
his part by promulgating two edicts; one dated October 12,
1386, instituting a <i>questua</i> (collection) in all the Ducal State
for the benefit of the funds for the Duomo; the second,
dated February 7, 1387, decreed that all the money from
the <i>paratici</i> of the city, which shall be paid as offerings
during the <i>fête</i> of the Madonna in February of this and
following years, shall be dedicated to the building fund.
The results of all these appeals and decrees, and the small
part the Visconti had in the giving, appears in a letter from
the deputies of the Fabbrica or Opera, addressed to Gian
Galeazzo, on August 3, 1387, saying&mdash;"Offerings have
been made with great devotion by every kind of person,
rich and poor, who have copiously and liberally aided the
building. Now, O Signore, we pray that you and your
lady mother, your consort, and daughter, may also transmit
your devout oblations to subsidize the church."</p>

<p>This is the way the funds were found, and now who
were the builders? We have seen in a former chapter that
the Visconti patronized the Campionese school of architect-sculptors,
and as the Comacines had been associated with
Milan for centuries, it was not necessary to look far for
architects. Indeed the very first batch of names which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
meets our eye in the books of the <i>laborerium</i> are all of the
Lombard Guild. Here is chief architect Simone da Arsenigo
written down as <i>ingegnere generale</i>; or <i>capo maestro</i>,
Guarnerio da Sirtori; Marco, Jacopo, e Zeno, da Campione;
and Andrea from Modena; where we have seen the
Campione Masters established a school.</p>

<p>On October 16, 1387, a meeting was held by the commission
of the Duomo to discuss a project proposed by the
administrators of the Fabbrica, for forming a regular
organization, and electing the proper officials. It was
decided&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To confirm the present deputies as superintendents
of the work. (Here we have the Tuscan <i>Operai</i>.)</p>

<p>2. To elect a treasurer-general.</p>

<p>3. To nominate a good and efficient accountant.</p>

<p>4. Also a good and efficient <i>spenditore</i> (in Tuscany this
is the <i>Provveditore</i>).</p>

<p>5. To confirm the election of Magister Simone da
Arsenigo as head architect of the building, and to nominate
enough capable Masters to assist him. (In Tuscany <i>capo
maestro</i> and <i>Maestri</i>.)</p>

<p>6. To confirm (considering their eminence in their art)
Dionisolo di Brugora and Ambrogio da Sala (an island
in Lake Como near Comacina) in their offices, and to
choose others equally good to aid in the building.</p>

<p>7. To elect two or more <i>probi uomini</i> (arbiters).</p>

<p>8. To elect lawyer, notary, and <i>sindaci</i> (consuls) of the
art.</p>

<p>9. "We also determine and ordain that Maestro Simone
da Arsenigo, as being chief architect of the said fabric, shall
order and provide for all the works done in the said church,
and that he shall show diligence, etc. etc...."</p>

<p>Here we have the exact organization we have seen at
Siena, Parma, Florence, etc.; and as there the Lombard
Masters are the founders of it, we find the same filing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
documents, the same assigning of different parts of the
building to different Masters, and the same calling of
councils in the guild to consider and value the work. The
registers of administration are kept in precisely the same
way. The <i>spenditore</i> keeps his books just as the Florentine
<i>Provveditore</i> does. Here are a few translations from the
bad Latin of his entries&mdash;</p>

<p>"1387. <i>January 15.</i>&mdash;For two lbs. of <i>morsecate</i> for
Maestro Andrea degli Organi, four lire." (Andrea degli
Organi of Modena was the Ducal architect, the father of
Filippo da Modena, a first-rate architect.)</p>

<p>"<i>January 19.</i>&mdash;For a Master and forty-seven workmen
to place the foundations of the pilasters."</p>

<p>"<i>March 19.</i>&mdash;To Simone da Arsenigo, chief architect,
for eighteen days in which he was engaged in work himself."
(This entry would seem to prove that when a Master did
manual work with his men, he was paid as they were in
addition to his salary as architect.)</p>

<p>"<i>April 2.</i>&mdash;To Maestro Marco da Frisone" (Magistro
Marcho de Frixono), "who was in the service of the Fabbrica,
and began to work on March 5, and finished on April
2, for his pay 12 lire 13 denari."</p>

<p>"<i>April 13.</i>&mdash;To Maestro Andrea da Modena, architect
to the Duke, for his pay for the days he gave to the church
in Milan, with the permission of the Vicario Sig. Giovanni
de Capelli, and the <i>XII di provisione</i>" (one of the city
councils, which acted as the president of the lodge, as the
Arte della Lana did in Florence), "and also of the deputies
of the Fabbrica, L. 19. 4."</p>

<p>"<i>May 2.</i>&mdash;Lent to Maestro Marco da Frisono, 22 lire."</p>

<p>"<i>August 12.</i>&mdash;For 84 workmen, 13 lire 13. 6. To 4
master builders, <i>i.e.</i> Giovanni da Arsenigo, 5 lire 10; to
Giovannino da Arsenigo, his son, 5. 10; to Giovanni da
Azzo, 5. 9; and Giovanni da Tr&oelig;nzano, 5. 9;&mdash;18 lire in all."</p>

<p>In August we get entries of expenses for rope to draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
water from the well, and rope for raising scaffolding, for
nails, baskets, plumb-lines, water-levels, red paint to mark
the planks, and other things. On October 9, 1387, we find
the <i>spenditore</i> paying a messenger to go to Crema with
letters from the lodge to Maestro Guglielmo di Marco, to
call him to Milan to give advice on business connected with
the buildings.</p>

<p>On October 15 Guglielmo di Marco is paid 16 lire for
his journey and eight days' employment in examining and
judging the work of the church.</p>

<p>On October 18, 1387, we have payment to Maestro
Simone da Arsenigo and ten companions (eleven in all),
master builders. To Maestro Zeno da Campione and twenty-one
companions (twenty-two including himself), master
sculptors of "living stone" (<i>pietra viva</i>). The word which
I translate companions is <i>sotiis</i> (<i>Mag. Symoni de Ursanigo
et sotiis, etc.</i>), which would imply that they were all members
(<i>soci</i>) of one society, and is thus valuable as a confirmation
of the brotherhood in this guild.</p>

<p>In October 1387, Andrea da Modena, the Duke's
architect, is again engaged, but only as adviser; for which
he receives <i>in dono fiorini venti</i>; and Leonardo Zepo and
Simone da Cavagnera are deputed to take note of his
suggestions.</p>

<p>"1387. <i>November 19.</i>&mdash;For the payment of two large
sheets of parchment consigned to Simone da Arsenigo."
(These must have been to draw the plans.)</p>

<p>"1388. <i>April 19.</i>&mdash;Paid Maestro Marco da Frixone and
<i>soci</i> for plaster to make models of the four <i>piloni</i>."</p>

<p>In another entry, noting the payment of 81 lire as
salary, Marco da Frixone is named as Marco da Campione
<i>detto</i> di Frisone.</p>

<p>Merzario is of opinion that such names as Marc the
Frisian, who was one of the Campione school; Jacopo
Tedesco, whom all old writers agree was Italian; Guglielmo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
d'Innspruck, also a Campionese, have been the cause of much
misunderstanding, and have sent authors off on false scents.
It was the custom, in the books of the Comacines, to name
people from their <i>provenienza</i>, i.e. the last place they came
from. Thus at Siena you will find Niccolò da Pisa, while
at Pisa he is Niccolò di Apulia. Lorenzo Maitani was
Lorenzo da Siena to the Orvieto people, and Lorenzo
d'Orvieto to the Florentines. Marco il Frisone, born at
Campione, is therefore a link between the German guilds
and the Italian; he must have worked at Friesland, and
probably brought back ideas of a more pointed Gothic from
there.</p>

<p>These registers are ample proof that the builders just
called in for the building of Milan cathedral were of the
Lombard Guild, and chiefly of the Campione branch. It is
not till 1389 that we find a single German name, and then
a certain "Anichino (Annex) di Germania" is paid 16
soldi for having made a model of a <i>tiburio</i> (cupola) in
lead, and Giacobino da Bruge, who falls ill while working
at the church, has a slight subsidy given by the guild
<i>per amor di Dio</i>. They are not mentioned again, and
neither of them seem to be Masters.</p>

<p>That Simone da Arsenigo was chief architect at this
time, not a doubt can exist. It is especially emphasized in
a deed executed in December 1387. In it the Administration,
"in consideration of their long and continued experience
of the pure and admirable goodwill, and the <i>opera
multifaria</i> which the worthy man, Magister Simone da
Arsenigo, most worthy chief architect and master, has
achieved in this church, by constant diligence, and wishing
to remunerate him better (pro aliquali remuneratione bene
meritorem), decide that whereas his salary hitherto has been
ten imperial soldi a day, it shall now be raised to ten gold
florins a month."</p>

<p>It is plain, however, that he worked in concert with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
guild. Just as at Florence and Siena, great councils of the
Masters, both architects and sculptors, were held to consider
whether the foundations were strong before continuing the
building, so in Milan a great meeting was called on Friday,
March 20, 1388, in which all the <i>Magistri</i> were cited before
their patrons, the Imperial Vicar-General, and the Council
of XII. (In Florence the Arte della Lana took the post
of President of the Works.) All the <i>Magistri</i> were charged
to give their opinion on the building in its present state,
and to suggest any improvements they could.</p>

<p>First uprose Master Marco da Campione (Surrexit
primus Magister Marchus de Campilione, Inzignerius), and
said there was an error in the wall on the side of Via
Compedo, the wall being, in one part, "half a quarter"
wider than the measure given. He suggested undoing that
part to the foundation.</p>

<p>Then the chief architect, Simone da Arsenigo, rose, and
proposed to cut the stones down to the ground, but not to
remove them.</p>

<p>Maestri Giacomo and Zeno agreed with Maestro Marco,
as did Maestro Guarnerio da Sirtori and Ambrogio
Pongione.</p>

<p>Then uprose Maestro Bonino da Campione (whom we
saw last at work on the Scaligers' tombs at Verona), and
said that he not only agreed with the others, but found an
error in the <i>piloni</i> in the body of the church, towards the
door of the façade.</p>

<p>Gasparolo da Birago, worker in iron, Magistri Ambrogio
da Melzo, Pietro da Desio, Filippo Orino, Ridolfo di
Cinisello, and Antonio da Tr&oelig;nzano, all voted with him.</p>

<p>The words "according to the measure given" (<i>justa
mensuram super hoc datam</i>), prove that however many
architects superintended special parts, there was one
supreme Master who made the design.</p>

<p>This was first, as we have said, Simone da Arsenigo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
and after him Marco the Frisian of Campione, whose salary
is paid on March 31, 1389, naming him as "Mag. Marcho
de Campilione dicto de Frixono inzegnerio fabricæ." His
name often appears as chief architect till July 10, 1390,
when "he died at the Ave Maria in the morning, and was
buried with honours the same evening in the church of S.
Thecla."<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266"  class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>One of Marco's contemporaries in the <i>laborerium</i> was
Jacopo da Campione, whose name appears with that of
Nicola del Bonaventura, and Matteo da Campione, and
others, at a general meeting held on January 6, 1390.
Historical authorities say Jacopo da Campione was of the
Buono family, and some assign as his father Giovanni
Buono. He, too, had a cognomen of Fuxina or Fusina,
but whether a family name or a place name I cannot tell.
His name first appears in the books of the guild with
Zambono, or Giovanni Buono, supposed to be his father,
with Magistri Zeno, Andriolo, Lazaro, Rolando, Fontana,
Cressino (all from Campione), and with Alberto, Airolo,
and Giovanni da Bissone, and Anselmo da Como. These
must have been the Masters who responded to the invitation
for architects sent out by the Milanese.</p>

<p>On April 15, 1389, Jacopo da Campione was elected
chief architect in connection with his friend Marco da
Campione.</p>

<p>A competition for designs for the great window of the
choir was announced in 1390, and Jacopo da Campione and
Niccola del Bonaventura each sent a design, from which the
archbishop was to choose. He preferred that of Bonaventura,
but the Master fell into disgrace, and his window was
never executed. We find that the Administration, on July
31, 1390, "deliberated" to discharge Master Bonaventura,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
give him the salary due to him, and remove him entirely
from the lodge. Jacopo da Campione remained in office
till the end of 1395, when he and Marco da Carona retired
for rest and change to Lake Lugano. They were not
allowed to be away long, for they were recalled on January
9, 1396.</p>

<p>During that year new honours were preparing for
Jacopo. Gian Galeazzo Visconti was intending to rebuild
the Certosa at Pavia, and set his eyes on Jacopo da
Campione as the best architect he could find for it. The
Masters of the Milan Lodge dared not dispute the will of
the all-powerful Duke, and held a meeting on March 4,
1397, at which it was decided "that Jacopo di Campione,
chief architect of the building, <i>qui acceptatus est super
laboreria Cartuxiæ</i>, should still retain his position in the
works of the Duomo, because the entire absence of the
Master who began the building (<i>qui principiavit ipsam
fabricam</i>) would cause grave peril and injury to the work.
They proposed, however, that Maestro Jacopo might, in
cases of necessity, assist in the building of the Certosa, as
he had done before."</p>

<p>This document sets the question beyond a doubt that
the architect who had most to do with the building of
Milan cathedral was this Jacopo of Campione, who had
worked with the first architect, Simone, and shared, on his
death, the post of chief, with Marco, his fellow-countryman.
He died on October 30, 1398.</p>

<p>During the time he was head of the <i>laborerium</i> several
Germans worked under him; Milan being so near the
German frontier was always a favourite object of German
travel. Moreover, I fancy there must during these centuries
have been a fraternal intercourse between the Italian
Masonic Guilds and those of Germany. We have so many
Italians who worked in Germany, and coming back were
dubbed with the name of the last place they came from,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
that it is equally likely that some Germans crossed the
border with those fellow-guildsmen on their return, and
worked at Milan. This intercourse between the two nations
would account for the more German style of Milan
cathedral as compared with other Italian churches.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_358">See page 358.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>I have before remarked that the lines of architecture
gradually take a more upward tendency the further north
we go. The slight point of the arch, as seen in Siena and
Orvieto and Florence, is much sharpened in Milan; the rows
of little round archlets which covered a Romanesque building
with rich horizontal lines, have here become elongated and
pointed, all the lines tending upwards, till they become
almost monotonous; yet Milan is but the natural northern
development of the southern Italian Gothic. It was always
the tendency of the guild to seek greater richness of
ornamentation in multiplying forms already customary to
them. As the Romanesque façade was merely a multiplication
of the Lombard single gallery, so the Gothic of
Milan is but a multiplication and elongation of the turrets
and pinnacles of Siena and Orvieto, and of the pointed
gables over elongated arches, with almost an abuse of the
perpendicular shaft. Of course I do not speak of the
façade in these remarks, that being a discord by the later
Renaissance architects. The changes may well have been
induced by the strong German influence in the guild.</p>

<p>There were also French artists, such as Jean Mignot de
Paris, and Jean de Campanias of Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267"  class="fnanchor">[267]</a> We hear of
a Niccolò Bonaventura from Paris, but his name is too Italian
for his nationality to be mistaken. He probably had been
employed in France, and brought back the French sculptor-architects
with him. All these names, with the Germans
mentioned below, are to be found in the report of a meeting
of <i>Magistri</i> in 1391. They are qualified as <i>Magistri di
pietra viva</i> (sculptors). The German names are, Ulrich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
de Frissengen di Nein, Aulx di Marchestein, and Johannes
Annex di "Friurgo" (Freiburg?). This last has been
confused by writers with Giovanni de Fernach, who was a
Campionese. Giovanni da Campione worked for many
years in Germany, and when he returned was as usual
dubbed a German, being called John from Fernach. He
brought a hundred stone-cutters to the service of the
Duomo of Milan in February 1391. The Administrators
approved of him, and considering that he knew Germany
and its language, and was a judge of good work, they sent
him to Cologne to try and procure some good architects.
He went, but finding no one of great talent, he returned
unsuccessful, and was obliged to refund to the guild half
the cost of his journey. As a compensation, the Administration
commissioned him to prepare a design for the
southern sacristy. He appears to have shut himself up to
prepare this great plan in secret, for on November 1, 1391,
the Deputies of the Administration order the <i>Provveditore</i>
to send "Giovannolo and Beltramolo" to get the Archbishop's
order to command Giovanni de Fernach to explain
his intention about the work on which he was engaged;
because, "if his plan was not approved, they would not wish
it proceeded with."</p>

<p>Then Fernach began to say that Johannes di Firimburg
was right, and that the proportions of the church, with
which his sacristy had to harmonize, were wrong. On this
the President, the Archbishop, and the Deputies sent to
Piacenza for an expert, named Gabriele Stornaloco, a great
geometrician, to settle the vexed question. He came,
made his calculations, and decided that the German critics
were in the wrong. Not satisfied with this, they next
prayed the Duke to send his sculptor, Bernardo da Venezia,
to give his opinion. He came to Milan in November
1391, made his computations, and also decided that the
Germans had made a mistake. Then Fernach's plan for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
the sacristy was handed over to the chief architect, Jacopo
da Campione, to modify its proportions; and Fernach's
name appears no more in the books of the <i>spenditore</i>.</p>

<p>Another German in the <i>laborerium</i> was an architect,
Magister Enrico or Ulrico di Ensingen, near Ulm. He
came in July 1391, but only remained a few months, and
then disappeared. Another Enrico or Ulrico (the <i>spenditore's</i>
orthography is diverse and mixed) da Gamodia or
Gmunden, then appears. This is the Heinrich of Gmunden,
whom the guide-books generally name as the architect of
the Duomo. We will now see precisely how much was
due to him. His name appears at a meeting on May 1,
1392, in which Jacopo da Campione, as usual, holds the
first place. Enrico da Gamodia, as he is written in the
books, was but lately <i>returned</i> (<i>ritornato</i>) from Germany,
and had offered himself to design and work in the building
of the Duomo. He allowed himself to raise doubts and
express censure of the solidity and strength of the work
already done. Public discussions were raised as to the
validity of his objections. A great meeting was called, in
which his name appears at the bottom of a long list of
Masters, all Italian. To the questions as to the solidity
and beauty of the building, and whether it should be continued
on the same plan or not, all the other Masters agreed
that the design could not be improved. Heinrich of
Gmunden alone answered stubbornly, <i>non assensit</i>.</p>

<p>The guild soon after decided on cutting off useless
expenses, and among others the salary of Magister Heinrich,
who was "dismissed," and "sent about his business"
(licentietur ad eundum pro factis suis). The German
appealed to the Duke of Milan, who begged the Deputati
to reconsider their decision. They, however, held firm, and
calling Heinrich before them on the 7th of the following
July, told him that he had not served the cause well (in
designamentis et aliis necessariis pro Fabrica male serviverit).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
They gave him six florins for his journey and
dismissed him. "Yet," as Merzario says,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268"  class="fnanchor">[268]</a> "to this man
who came to Milan at the end of 1391, and left in the
middle of 1392, is given by many people the credit of
having designed the Duomo of Milan, which was begun
in 1386, and also of the Certosa of Pavia begun in 1396."</p>

<p>Nor did Ulrich da Ulm, whom we have mentioned,
achieve much more than his compatriot. He came in 1391,
and only stayed a few months. In 1394, however, he again
offered his services, and was reinstalled on a profitable contract.
But he too had the national spirit of criticism, and
vaunted his own plans of improving the church, while he
detailed his opinion of the flaws in the existing plans, and
doubts on the stability of the building. Of course a meeting
of the lodge was called, and as before the majority
went against Ulrich's new improvements. However, they
sent to Pavia to ask the Duke to let his architect, Nicola
de Lelli, come to Milan and arbitrate. He replied that they
had better send a deputation with all the plans to Pavia, as
he could not spare the architect. So the <i>capo maestro</i>,
Jacopo da Campione, and Giovannino de' Grassi accompanied
Ulrich to Pavia, to confer with the Duke and his
architects, with the result that the present work was pronounced
good, and Ulrich's designs and innovations rejected.
The <i>spenditore</i> records that Ulrich's salary was paid: he
too was sent off (ad eundum pro factis suis).</p>

<p>During the three following years no German names are
met with in the books. Then came the death of Jacopo da
Campione in 1398, and the <i>laborerium</i> seems to have had no
capable Master to replace him. And now we shall see how
this Masonic Guild was ramified throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The Deputies sent to Giovanni Alcherio, a Milanese
living in Paris, to see if some architect could be spared
from the works at Notre Dame. He proposed Jean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Campanias from Normandy and Jean Mignot of Paris,
mentioned above, who were accepted, and came to Milan in
1399, with a painter named Jacopo Cova. Mignot was
made architect of the two sacristies. He coveted the
supreme post of chief architect of the whole building, but
he met with serious rivals in Marco da Carona and Antonio
da Padernò, two young <i>Magistri</i> who were fast rising in
the guild to fill the place of Jacopo and Marco da Campione
and Simone da Arsenigo.</p>

<p>There was schism in the guild. Mignot found fault
with everything in the Duomo, the size, the proportions,
the <i>piloni</i>, the capitals, the windows, the tracery, and all the
ornamentation. Marco and Antonio declared that Mignot's
sacristy was of a false rule of measurement, and the arch of
his window wrong in its lines. There were meetings in
the lodge, and endless disputes, till Mignot also disappeared
from the scene.</p>

<p>The Campione school of Masters still held its own:
we now find that Matteo da Campione was sent for from
Monza. Zeno da Campione, brother of the late Jacopo,
also came with two hundred and fifty stone-cutters under
him to carve the capitals, pinnacles, etc. etc. There was
Lorenzo degli Spazi di Laino in Val d'Intelvi, also of the
same school, who brought one hundred and eighty-eight stone-carvers
to the <i>laborerium</i>, and who won fame for the fine
sculpture they produced. Can one wonder at the wealth of
sculpture in and on the cathedral, when only two <i>Magistri</i>
can furnish more than four hundred workmen between
them? When one looks at the lavish marble work on the
roof, the plurality of artists is well accounted for.</p>

<p>Giovannino dei Grassi, or Gracii, seems to have succeeded
Jacopo as <i>capo maestro</i>, and his designs and Jacopo's
were kept with reverence in the rooms of the Administration.</p>

<p>In 1400 Jacopo da Tradate is the "supreme sculptor" to
the fabric. He did the statue of Martin V. in commemoration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
of that Pope's visit to Milan in 1418, after the Council
of Constance, when he consecrated the principal altar.
Jacobino da Tradate also sculptured the mausoleum of
Pietro, son of Guido Torello, Marquis of Guastalla, in
S. Eustorgio at Milan. His son, Samuele, was a friend of
Andrea Mantegna's, and once visited him on the Lago
di Garda. He too was a sculptor, and made his father's
tomb in the cloister of S. Agnese, which he inscribed&mdash;"Jacobino
de Tradate patri suaviss:&mdash;Qui tamquam
Praxiteles vivos in marmore fingebat vultus&mdash;Samuel
observantis. V. F."</p>

<p>In 1402 Duke Gian Galeazzo died, and during the
minority of his son, art, architecture, and sculpture languished.
Few famous names are preserved, and all of
those were from the neighbourhood of Como. Those
mentioned in the books as continuing the work between
1402 and 1440, are Jacopo da Tradate, Bertollo da Campione,
Giorgio de Sollario, sculptors, and Paolino da
Montorfano, a painter. At a later period other Masters
appeared, and we find Giovanni de Solari from Val d'Intelvi,
Guglielmo di Giorgio and Giovanni di Reghezio, Jacopo da
Lanzo, Michele di Benedetto da Campione, Francesco
Solari, and Giovanni da Cairate, all sculptors, with Cristoforo
da Chiona, Arasmino Solari da Arogna, Franceschino
da Canobbio, Leonardo da Sirtori, Paolino da Arsenigo,
and Giovanni Solari, all Lombard engineers and architects.</p>

<p>Of all this crowd, two men rose to especial eminence:
Magister Filippino degli Argani da Modena, and Giovanni
Solari da Campione, who had a special connection with the
domestic Gothic architecture of Venice. Filippino was son
of Andrea degli Argani, architect to the Visconti. He
showed so much talent for his father's profession that Duke
Gian Galeazzo himself nominated him as a novice in the
lodge of the guild. A letter, dated January 8, 1400, was
addressed by the Duke to the Administrative Council of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
lodge, saying&mdash;"Considering the fine genius shown even in
boyhood by Filippo, son of our architect, the late Maestro
of Modena, we advise that his talents shall be cultivated,
and that he shall be practised in the technical arts, especially
by the assistance and instruction of good masters....
Therefore we decree that the said Filippino shall enter the
said <i>laborerium</i> (of the Duomo at Milan), and we recommend
him for instruction therein."<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269"  class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_519" id="i_519"></a>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_363">See page 363.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Filippino so far justified this recommendation, that when,
on March 6, 1412, a competition was offered for designs for
the window behind the choir, he won the commission.
Many authors, not heeding the authentic documents, have
given the credit of that window to Buonaventura from Paris.
In 1404 Filippino was made <i>Magister</i> of the guild, and
given office under Marco da Carona. In 1406 he sculptured
a beautiful sepulchre to Marco Corello, a Milanese
who had left all his patrimony to the works of the Duomo.
On Marco da Carona's death he became chief architect of
the cathedral, with the three <i>Magistri</i>, Magatto, Leonardo
da Sirtori, and Cristoforo da Chiona under him. An act
passed by the guild on May 19, 1417, confirms him as
"Superior et prior aliorum inzigneriorum de fabbrica," on a
term of twelve years, at a salary of twenty florins a month.
At the expiration of the twelve years he was not removed
from office, but was given two colleagues with equal power
to his own. These were Franceschino da Canobbio and
Antonio da Gorgonzola.</p>

<p>In April 1448, much to his disgust, Filippo was entirely
suspended. Francesco Sforza interceded on his behalf with
the Administration, but they replied that Franceschino suited
them better. Again in 1450, when the Duchess Bianca
Visconti recommended Filippo's son Giorgio as a worthy
successor to his father, the Council again asserted that they
had no wish to discharge Franceschino da Canobbio. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
the Duke, irritated by this repulse, wrote the following
strong letter to the Council&mdash;"Our beloved (<i>Dilecti nostri</i>).
As the illustrious Madonna Bianca our Consort has advised
you, and considering the respect and devotion which the
late Magister Filippino bore to the memory of our Consort's
late celebrated father, also considering his valuable and
praiseworthy works, in the building of the cathedral, and
other edifices and fortresses, I beg that you will be pleased
to elect as architect to the Duomo, Magister Giorgio, son
of the said late Magister Filippino, with the usual salary,
and nothing less. If you wish, you are at liberty to elect
four experts, who shall inform themselves of the capabilities
of the said 'Magister Zorgo,' and whether he be sufficient
for the post. We shall be obliged if you will nominate him
to the said office on the usual terms, by which you will
also oblige our Consort. Given from Milan, November
7, 1450."</p>

<p>The Council had to bow to this command, but the
nomination of Giorgio "degli Argani" was not decided on
till the meeting of July 6, 1451, and then only a moderate
salary was given him, "want of funds being assigned by
them as a reason." Giorgio's death, occurring soon after,
ended the difficulty, and Giovanni Solari became his successor.
A convention, dated September 24, 1450, between
some masters and the Council, concludes&mdash;"It is to be
observed that Giovanni di Solari is the head architect
deputed to this work, which must be done according to his
designs and conditions."</p>

<p>Giovanni was the son of Marco da Carona, formerly
chief architect. In the deed of his nomination is the
sentence&mdash;"son of the late Marco, who through all his life
exercised the office of architect in such a mode that few or
none could even equal him."<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270"  class="fnanchor">[270]</a>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_368">See page 368.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Two months after this election, Duke Francesco Sforza
wrote a very commanding letter from the camp at Trignano,
saying, he recommended the nomination of Antonio da
Firenze (Filarete) and Giovanni da Solari, in place of
Filippino degli Argani. The latter was already at his post,
but the Council again defied the Duke by saying they had
no need of Filarete; on which the Duke retired from his
self-imposed office of adviser, and left the lodge to manage
its own business, which it always intended to do. Giovanni
da Solari being left in peace, carried on the works, and so
beautiful were they, that even to the <i>Magistri</i> themselves
the building seemed "more divine than human."</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son, Magister Guiniforte,
whose name is sometimes misspelt Boniforte. He was "a
man of clear mind, exquisite sense and strong will; educated
amidst grand ideas and grand things by a wise and talented
father; he became <i>Magister</i> at twenty-two years of age,
and worked under his father." When he was thirty-seven,
he took Filarete's place, as chief architect of the Ospedale
Maggiore at Milan, a work almost perfect in its harmonious
beauty, and yet showing in every line its derivation from
the civil edifices of the older Lombards. He was also
architect at the Certosa, and built, or rather designed, the
churches of S. Satiro and the Madonna delle Grazie and
the castle of Alliate. Calvi says that Guiniforte, "though
following the older school, knew how to lighten the serious
northern style, by giving it the smile of Italian skies."</p>

<p>When Guiniforte died in 1481, his son, Pietro Antonio,
armed with a letter of recommendation from the Princess
Bona, presented himself at the lodge, as a candidate for
his father's position. The Freemason Council, however,
seemed determined not to bow to royal commands, and
again asserted its independence. Pietro was put off, and in
1489 he departed to Russia.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271"  class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>During the years from 1468 to 1492, the books of the
lodge, preserved in the archives, abound in names of
<i>Magistri</i> from the neighbourhood of Como, both architects
and sculptors.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272"  class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Among them are some famous names, such as Martino
da Mantegazza, Dolcebono Rodari (sculptor of the
beautiful north door at Como), and Gerolamo della Porta,
who entered the lodge in May 1490, with a letter of
recommendation from the Duke, advising his being specially
trained in the art of sculpture. His talents warranting
this, he was sent to Rome with four other stone-sculptors,
to remain ten years, and perfect themselves in sculpture, to
study the antique, and to return to the <i>laborerium</i> as fully
qualified masters. There was also Bartolommeo da
Campione, who carved some of the richly ornate capitals of
the columns. I suspect he was the man who became
famous in Venice.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Milan was now reaching completion.
There only remained the crucial question of the dome, and
with this the Masters now occupied themselves. Jacopo da
Campione had made a model which the Council of Administration
preserved in their rooms, together with a beautifully
made wooden model begun by Giovannino de' Grassi, and
finished on his death by his son, Salomone. These were
not adopted, for on Giovanni Solari's death in 1471, we
find the name of <i>Bartolomeus de Gorgonzola, magister super
Tiburium</i>. This was on September 26, 1472. The same
phrase is repeated in another entry on November 25, 1471,
where a payment is registered, made to Branda da Castiglione,
on account of the work he has to do at Gandolia, in
making certain columns to place above the <i>Tiburio</i>.</p>

<p>The difficult work was suspended on the assassination
of Duke Galeazzo Maria, by reason of want of funds.
On the restoration of Gian Galeazzo in 1482, the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
was again under consideration, and in the absence of any
very eminent Masters at the moment&mdash;Guiniforte having
died in 1481&mdash;the Duke wrote to Strasburg to beg that
some architects might be spared from the works there. This
action is very suggestive of an affinity between the German
and Italian Masonic Lodges. No one could be spared from
Strasburg, but a certain Giovanni da Gratz came over with
a little squadron of Germans, and signed a contract to
superintend the "reparation and completion" of the <i>Tiburio</i>
of the Duomo. The conditions of the contract further
stated that when the cupola should be so far finished as to
allow of inspection, a committee of qualified Masters should
be elected to inspect it, and pronounce if the work were
good.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273"  class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>The words "reparation and completion" would imply
that Guiniforte and Bartolommeo had already begun the
dome. The contract with John of Gratz is signed May
1482, and it would appear not to have been of long duration,
no payments being made to him after February
1486, and on January 26, 1488, the annals of the Duomo
show the following entry&mdash;"To Maestro Antonio da
Padernò in recompense for his labours during the past year
in verifying the errors committed by Maestro Giovanni da
Gratz, etc...." Like his forerunner Heinrich da Gmunden,
John of Gratz had to retire from the Milanese Lodge; his
name is no more found in the books, and the Council began
to search for a <i>capo maestro</i> nearer home. Magister Luca
Paperio Fancelli was called from Florence to examine some
designs which had been sent in. The one chosen was by
Leonardo of Florence (Da Vinci), who was paid in anticipation
L.56, and a <i>Maestro in legname</i> was assigned
as his assistant, named Bernardino da Abbiate. He
probably was to superintend the scaffolding, and Da Vinci
the building. However, the engagement fell through, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
the Duke of Milan wrote to the Pope, the King of Sicily,
and the rulers of Venice and Florence to find an architect
for that puzzling cupola. Two Germans, one named
Lorenzo, and one a monk, John Mayer, were successively
refused. At length, in 1490, the Council finally commissioned
Maestro Giovan Antonio Amadeo and Maestro Gio.
Giacomo Dolcebuono as joint architects "to finish the
cupola and the church." They were to choose the model
which pleased them best of those preserved in the Administration,
and the one they selected was to be examined
for approval by Maestro Francesco di Giorgio, then living
at Siena, and by Maestro Luca of Florence (Fancelli), then
residing at Mantua, two experts who were by the Council
elected as judges and examiners of the perfection of the
model.</p>

<p>A great meeting of the <i>Magistri</i> of the lodge, and the
patron of the city, presided over by the Duke himself, met
on June 27, to examine the several models, but none were
chosen; and Amadeo and Dolcebuono were ordered to
make a revised model, with the concurrence of Francesco
Giorgio. The two former were then confirmed as joint
architects, "to compose and ordinate"&mdash;as the Verbale
quaintly puts it&mdash;"all the parts needful to constitute the
said <i>Tiburio</i>, which must be beautiful, worthy, and eternal,"
if indeed earthly things can be eternal.</p>

<p>Francesco di Giorgio departed laden with presents and
payments, and with the honorary title of architect of the
Duomo of Milan; and on September 9, the two others
began their work, which they brought to a happy conclusion
on September 24, 1500.</p>

<p>The façade was, however, not completed. Indeed, the
registers show that the insignia of the Comacine Masters,
the marble lions which were destined for the great door,
were in 1489 still in deposit in the <i>laborerium</i>.</p>

<p>Dolcebuono died in 1506; and Andrea Fusina was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
elected in his place. The famous sculptor, Cristoforo
Gobbo, entered the works in 1502, on the compact that
he was not to be under the orders of other architects, but
to make his own contracts. He executed much of the
sculptural ornamentation of the cupola; such as the Doctors
of the Church in medallions; while a master Andrea da
Corcano, with other "brethren," did the pictures. Cristoforo
also carved the famous statues of Adam and Eve on
the façade, besides several other statues. He and Fusina
being compatriots, fraternized, and opposed Amadeo, who
had made a too daring design for the lantern on the cupola.
Meetings after meetings were held, and at length Gobbo
retired temporarily to pursue his sculpture in Rome and
Venice, where he is entered as Cristoforo <i>da Milano</i>. His
nephew, Michele da Merate, and Michele's son Paolo, both
sculptors, worked with him at Milan, where he continued
till his death, in 1527.</p>

<p>Another long list of names from the books, given
between 1500 and 1550 by Merzario, proves that the
Comacines still reigned supreme in the <i>laborerium</i>, the
Solari family preponderating.</p>

<p>As if to connect the last link in the chain with the first,
we find the old family of Bono da Campione still prominent.
For nearly thirty years, <i>i.e.</i> between 1618 and 1647,
Magister Gian Giacomo Bono da Campione sculptured in
the <i>laborerium</i> of the Duomo, and there his son Francesco
was trained, besides two kinsmen&mdash;Carlo Antonio Bono,
painter and sculptor, and his son, Giuseppe. All this family
worked together in the seventeenth century at the façade of
the cathedral, designed by Pellegrini. The fine central door
was the work of Gian Giacomo Bono and Andrea Castelli,
both Comacines by birth.</p>

<p>As for the names of other Comacines who worked at
the façade and on the wondrous roof, one finds them by
hundreds in the annals of the Duomo, as collected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Giulini in his <i>Memorie della Città e Campagna di Milano</i>.
Here you see names repeated which have been familiar in
the guild for centuries; such as the Bono and Solari
families, and Luca Beltrami, who worked at the façade in
the seventeenth century, and whose ancestors were architects
at Modena and Parma two hundred years earlier.</p>

<p>Whatever were the faults of Gian Galeazzo Visconti,
the world has one great and beautiful legacy to thank him
for&mdash;the Certosa of Pavia.</p>

<p>It is said that Stefano Maconi, prior of the Certosa at
Garignano, suggested to the Duke the building of the
finest monastery in Italy; but the funds were certainly
provided by Gian Galeazzo, who took a personal and
untiring interest in the work.</p>

<p>The first documental proof of this is a deed of gift,
dated April 15, 1396, whereby Gian Galeazzo gives to the
monastery of the Certosa, landed property to the annual
value of 2500 gold florins. On October 6 of the same
year, he makes another endowment of property, yielding
5500 gold florins a year, besides an annual subsidy of
10,000 florins from his own private purse.</p>

<p>The history of this beautiful building is much connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
with that of Milan cathedral; the same architects&mdash;or
rather brethren of the same Masonic Lodge&mdash;worked at
both; and at one time Jacopo da Campione was <i>capo
maestro</i> of both works at once, spending a certain proportion
of his time at both.</p>

<p>Heinrich of Gmunden has had a good deal of credit for
this building; so much so that a certain bust, said to be
his likeness, was kept in the sacristy of the Certosa;
and on the strength of that bust, the Germans erected a
statue to him in Gmunden. But as he left Italy in July
1392, dismissed from Milan after a few months there, it is
not probable that he could have designed the Certosa in
1396. Count Giulini was the first to draw attention to
this error; and a learned archivist, Girolamo L. Calvi,
had the good luck to discover in the archives of S. Fedele,
the ancient register of the Administration of the building of
the Certosa for the year 1396, which settles the matter
completely. The master builder was Bernardo da Venezia,
and Jacopo da Campione worked with him as designing
architect and superintendent. On the official verification
of this precious MS. on April 16, 1862, the bust of
Heinrich da Gmunden disappeared from the sacristy of the
Certosa.</p>

<p>As a proof that the <i>Magistri</i> mentioned were both
employed, we will translate a few of the entries of the
<i>Provveditore</i> of the Certosa.</p>

<p>"1396. <i>July 26.</i>&mdash;In the presence of Pietro Barboti,
official of the Administration, Berto Cordono, cordmaker,
was paid for 138 lbs. of strong cord, for use in the designing
and building of the church and cloister. The cord
was consigned in June, at the order of Maestro Bernardo
da Venezia, architect of the said <i>laborerium</i>" (Inzignerium
dicti laborerii).</p>

<p>"1396. <i>August 14.</i>"&mdash;(This should, I think, be September
14). After registering several payments of wages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
to workmen who excavated the foundations, it is written&mdash;"Also
the above-named Jacopo da Campione, for his superintendence
of the works (tantum qui perseveravit superdictis
laboreriis), together with the Duke's architects during
fourteen days (<i>i.e.</i> the last days of August and the first two
of the present September), at the rate of eight imperial
soldi a day, as he had to find his own food."</p>

<p>"1396.&mdash;The Magistri Jacopo da Campione, Giovannino
de Grassi, and Marco da Carona, architects, came from
Milan to inspect, order, and build in the aforenamed works"
(causa videndi ordinandi et hedificandi). The two latter
must have been the Duke's architects spoken of before.
All through August and September Jacopo da Campione
was backwards and forwards between Milan and Pavia,
and Maestro Bernardo also received his salary monthly as
chief architect.</p>

<p>Again, on November 22, 1396, we read&mdash;"To Master
Jacopo da Campione, architect of Milan cathedral (inzignerio
ecclesiæ majoris Mediolani), for fourteen days
during October and November, in which he remained
working and superintending in the said <i>laborerium</i> (Certosa)
at his own expense, and in payment for some designs
made by him at Milan, and submitted to the Duke's
approval here."</p>

<p>On December 4, 1396, the <i>Provveditore</i> notes the purchase
of twenty sheets of parchment, most of which were
consigned to the Magistri Jacopo da Campione and Cristoforo
da Lonigo for the designs of the church. From these
entries, it would seem that Jacopo was the architect who
drew the designs, and Bernardo da Venezia the master
builder who executed them. As a farther proof, there is
the deliberation of the Administration of Milan, on March
4, 1397, to which we have already referred, in which it says
that Jacopo was in command of the works at Certosa (qui
acceptatus est super laboreria Carthusiæ).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<p>Other Campionese names also appear in the registers;
such as Domenico Bossi da Campione, who was paid "for
four marble slabs, with certain inscriptions, which were
placed under the foundations when the Visconti laid the
first stone on August 27, 1396;" and "Giovanni da
Campione, called Bosio, for three sculptured marble slabs
for three reliquaries."</p>

<p>In 1397, Gian Galeazzo, being taken up with affairs of
state, ceded the presidency of the Administration of the
Certosa Lodge to the Prior of the Carthusians, adding more
donations and an endowment. The Prior's first actions
were to dismiss Bernardo da Venezia as master builder,
and to call Antonio di Marco from Crema. He was son of
Marco da Campione, one of the chief architects of Milan
cathedral, and brother of Guglielmo di Marco, whom we
have also found at Milan in 1387, where he was called as
an expert to give judgment on some moot point.</p>

<p>When Antonio entered office, the monastery had twenty-four
cells already inhabited by as many monks, under their
Abbot, Father Bartolommeo of Ravenna. As soon as the
contract was signed, it appears that Antonio returned to
Crema, leaving Giovanni Solari da Campione, father of
Guiniforte, and Francesco Solari, in charge. In the payments
made to Giovanni as chief architect, we find his name
written in different ways. In one, "<i>Magister Johanni de
Campilioni Ingenerio fabrice Monasterii LXVI</i>." In
another, "<i>Magister Johanni di Solerio Inzignero super
laboreriis fabrice Monasterii die XIV Maij, pro suo salario
LXVI</i>;" sometimes he is merely written as "<i>Johanni
Inzegnero</i>."</p>

<p>These payments go on for at least four years, during
which time Antonio di Marco seems to have had little to
do with the building. Sometimes Giovanni Solari even
does the commercial business. In 1429, the register notes
4 lire, 5 soldi paid to him for his expenses in going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Milan and Pavia, on business connected with the building,
and in the same year he pays six Masters who come from
Milan to Certosa, when there was a competition for some
sculptures in marble for the monastery.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274"  class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The sculptors
working under him were mostly his compatriots. Here are
<i>Maestri</i> Rodari da Castello, Giovanni da Garvagnate, and
Giovanni da Como paid for sculptural works in 1428 and
1429; also <i>Maestro</i> Antonio and <i>Maestro</i> Giovanni di Val
di Lugano, employed as builders (rattione edificiorum
novorum).</p>

<p>There are also frequent mentions of Jacopo Fusina, and
the two Solari, who form such a link between Milan and
Venice. The Solari were the stock from which came the
famous line of Lombardi, who may be almost called the
makers of Venice.</p>

<p>To this little group of architects we owe the exquisite
cloister of the Certosa, with its labyrinth of fairy white
marble columns, and the ruddy beauty of ornamentation on
terra-cotta arches. Our illustration shows the beauty of
Campionese work at this era.</p>

<p>Giovanni Solari of Campione, who is said in this work
to have inaugurated the beautiful terra-cotta architecture of
Lombardy, appears to have held office as chief architect up
to nearly 1460, when his son Guiniforte succeeded him.
Under Guiniforte, Gio. Antonio Amadeo, or Omodeo,
entered his novitiate. When, in 1466, he reached the age
of nineteen, he was already engaged at the Certosa as a
sculptor. A deed drawn up by the notary Gabbi, on
October 10, 1469, shows that the Administration lent him
certain blocks of marble, for which he was to pay their
equivalent in work; the payment he made was the beautiful
door leading from the church into the cloister, still known
as "the door of Amadeo." It is exquisitely decorated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Bramantesque style; reliefs of angels and foliage surround
the door; and in the tympanum is a fine relief of the
Virgin and Child. He, too, became famous in Venice, as
did the two brothers Cristoforo and Antonio Mantegazza,
who had just been trained under Jacopo da Tradate at
Milan. Indeed, the network of this marvellous company
of sculptor-builders is at this epoch interwoven in a most
complicated manner between Milan, Certosa, Como, Monza,
and Venice.</p>

<p>The façade of the Certosa forms precisely the same
discord with the body of the building that the façade of
Milan does, but here the Renaissance face is so rich and
gorgeous that one almost forgives the discord. It has
been attributed to Bramante of Urbino, whose name never
appears in the books; to Bernardo of Venice, who died
long before it was begun; and to Borgognone the painter,
who was only invited to the Certosa by the Prior in 1490,
when the façade was well begun.</p>

<p>Sig. Merzario, with his documental evidence,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275"  class="fnanchor">[275]</a> proves
that Guiniforte di Solario certainly designed it, and for the
most part superintended its execution. On January 14,
1473, the notary Gabbi registered a contract between the
Prior of the Certosa and the Administration of the Milan
Lodge, for the furnishing of 200 cwts. of white marble of
Gandoglia, annually, for ten years, to serve for the façade
of the Certosa church. On October 7, 1473, the same
notary makes the contract, by which the brothers Cristoforo
and Antonio Mantegazza are commissioned to erect all
the façade, according to the plans given them by the
monastery.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276"  class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_378">See pages 378</a>, <a href="#Page_379">379</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This contract very much offended Gio. Antonio Amadeo,
who had gone to Bergamo to make a monument for the
Colleoni family, and he appealed to the Colleoni, and also
to the Duke of Milan, to enforce his claims on the work,
which were so far recognized that he was engaged to do
half the work, at a price to be estimated, receiving a <i>podere</i>
(vineyard) in part payment.</p>

<p>Another act of notary, dated October 12, 1478, records
the ceremony of valuing several works of sculpture, by
Amadeo and the brothers Mantegazza, by two Masters of
the guild, Giovanni, junior, da Campione, and Luchino of
Cernuscolo, which took place in the presence of the Prior
and the chief architect, Guiniforte Solari;&mdash;a proof that
Solari was still the <i>capo maestro</i>. He died early in
January 1481, and on the 13th of the same month,
Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza wrote to the "Dominis Priori
et monacis Carthusie Papiensis," to recommend his son,
"Pietro Antonio (suo figliuolo peritissimo de la medesima
arte et de divino ingenio"), as a worthy successor to his
father as chief architect. Antonio Mantegazza succeeded
him, but he, too, died in 1495, and Cristoforo Solario,
named Gobbo, who had worked with him, became architect
in his turn. His election was on October 11, 1495, by the
recommendation of Ludovico il Moro. Gobbo, however,
did not long remain in office, for in 1497 we find him
employed at the Duomo of Milan, and the sepulchre of
Beatrice d'Este, at the church of the Grazie there. In 1506
he became head architect at Milan.</p>

<p>In 1499, a letter from B. Calco, dated May 1, declares
that the works at the Certosa are nearly finished (sarà
presto presso el fine).<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"  class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The church had already been opened for service since
May 1497, when the Cardinal di S. Croce came in state to
consecrate it, and a grand refection was offered him. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
documents cited by Sig. Merzario are certainly conclusive
as to the epoch and authorship of both the convent and the
church.</p>

<p>We must not leave the Lombard Lodge without a
mention of one of its principal Masters, Matteo da Campione,
who was architect for the fourteenth-century restoration of
the cathedral at Monza, which his forerunners of the guild
had built for Queen Theodolinda. He is spoken of in the
registers at Milan, when he attended a general meeting of
the guild there on January 6, 1390, as Matteo da Campione
"inzignero in Monza," and again on July 10, 1390, when,
on the death of Marco da Campione, it was deliberated in
council to send for Maestro Matteo from Monza, and see
whether he would take Marco's place in the works. He
was, like almost all the Comacines, a sculptor as well as
architect. The baptismal font at Monza, which was once
noted for its beauty, is now ruined and mutilated. The
pulpit and the sculptures on the façade of Monza cathedral
are attributed to Matteo's own hand. The pulpit is a fine
piece of sculpture in white marble. It was originally
square, but has been altered in form during the last century.
Fourteen figures, the twelve apostles with St. Paul and
Barnabas, are sculptured around it, and there are many
small reliefs. It has a prominent part in the front, called
by the Italians the <i>pulpitino</i>, or little pulpit. On this are
sculptured the Redeemer with a book, and a thunderbolt
in His hands, and the four Evangelists. The façade is a
curious instance of the transition of Comacine art, between
the Romanesque and the Gothic. The door is very much
like those of Verona and other Comacine churches of the
same era. Matteo has put his lions in front of the pillars
of the porch, instead of beneath them. The mixture of
style shows more in the windows. The four lower windows
are distinctly Gothic, with pointed arches, three lights, and
Gothic tracery; the upper ones are round-arched Lombard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
two-light windows, the archlets of which are a little cusped.
The lines of the façade are quite Lombard, the internal
divisions being marked on the front by pilasters running
the whole height. The Lombard gallery is indicated like
a memory of past time by a row of archlets beneath the
eaves, but they rest on nothing, and are of no practical use
as their prototypes were. Probably, as the interior was not
rebuilt, Matteo da Campione so far respected the work of
his older brethren, as to adapt his façade to the rest of the
building. Over the portico is a fine rose window, and
above that a row of saints in niches; the space between
them is filled with geometrical sculpture. He has used the
ancient sculpture of "Agilulf and Theodolinda" in the
lunette of the doorway. Its style is much earlier than the
figures above. Matteo was buried in the church, and on
his tomb is the inscription&mdash;"Hic jacet magnus ille ædificator
devotus magister Mattheus de Campiliono, qui hujus
sacrosanctæ Ecclesiæ fatiem ædificavit evangelistarium ac
battisterium qui obiit anno Domini MCCCLXXXXVI die
XXIV mensio maii." It is said that he has sculptured his
own likeness in the rigid and thoughtful figure of the saint
near the turret, over the rose window.</p>

</div>

<p>Another work which we have seen commenced by
earlier Comacines was the cathedral of Como. That too
was restored and redecorated by Comacines about this time.
The old church had been ruined in the wars between Como
and Milan, and in 1335, Azzo Visconti, building his fortresses
at Como, ran his walls close round the church, cutting it off
from the town. In 1386, however, the Bishop of Como persuaded
Gian Galeazzo to transpose his fort and open the
church again to the people. In gratitude for this, the people
proposed to restore their church, and Gian Galeazzo
promised his aid. The work was begun in 1396 and went
on till 1513. Authors disagree as to whether the church
were renovated, <i>i.e.</i> restored, or rebuilt. Whichever it was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
there is no doubt that the whole façade was executed in
the fifteenth century. The north door is of rich ornate
Renaissance style, and much later than that on the façade,
although the lions are still under the columns. The façade
follows in its lines the old Lombard form, but the dividing
pilasters here are lavishly enriched. They are in fact but
a perpendicular line of niches with a statue in each. The
three doorways are round-arched, the windows above them
slightly pointed. Over the central door is a Gothic vestibule
with saints in its canopied arches.</p>

<p>The first architect of the restoration is indicated in the
register of the Milan Lodge, where on April 30, 1396,
Magister Lorenzo degli Spazi de Laino in Val d'Intelvi is
allowed to leave the works at Milan to be chief architect at
Como, "deliberarunt quod licentietur Magister Laurentius
de Spatiis ad eundum Cumas pro laborerio Ecclesie majoris
civitatis Cumarum ad requisitionem comunis et hominum
dicte civitatis Cumarum." He had not long entered on
office when Gian Galeazzo died, and Como was again
involved in a fight for freedom with Malatesta and the
Visconti. In 1416 the Como people had to swear allegiance
to Milan, and then Duke Filippo Maria Visconti allowed
the works to go on. On February 19, 1439, Pietro da
Bregia near Como was elected master architect, and he
continued Lorenzo de Spazi's work. He changed the plan
so as to bring the façade in a line with the Broletta and
tower of the fortress, which altogether made an imposing
mass of buildings; very interesting as displaying at once the
Comacine work in civil, military, and ecclesiastical architecture.
The Broletta is a particularly good specimen of
their civil architecture, of about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1000, though it loses
in proportion owing to the filling up of the lower level on
which it was built, so that the bases of the columns are
completely buried.

<p class="p2">The connection of the Comacines of Longobardic times
with Venice, through the powerful Lombard Dukes of
Friuli, and the Patriarchs of Aquileja, their metropolitan
bishops, has already been touched upon; and we have
mentioned the Patriarch Fortunatus for whom the Masonic
Guild built the churches of Grado and Torcello. The
Comacines had, in the eighth century, also built the
Baptistery of Calixtus at Cividale, and had sculptured the
altar of Duke Pemmo in Friuli; in the twelfth century they
rebuilt the Duomo of Cividale for the Patriarch Pellegrino....
This connection was still further strengthened, when
in 1311 the Visconti conquered and exiled from Milan
the Torriani family, their rivals in the Signory there, who
retired to Friuli, where they soon acquired supreme power.
Two of the family, Raimondo and Pagano della Torre, had
previously been successively Patriarchs of Aquileja, and in
1317, Gastone, the exiled Archbishop of Milan, succeeded
Pagano. A second Pagano and a Ludovico Torriani
followed him. The Torriani were from Valsassina near
Como, and would consequently have had more interest in
the Comacine Guild than any other, if other there were;
in fact the tombs of the Torriani at Primaluna and at
Chiaravalle show unmistakable signs of Comacine work.
At Sacile in the Friuli district the ancient church with three
naves, built in 1400, can show documents proving its architects
to have been Beltramo and Antonio, both of Como, and
who form a link with the Roman Lodge. The church of
Gemona, on the mountains near Tagliamento, was built by
Giovanni Bono, another familiar Comacine name. The
choir is in transition style, <i>i.e.</i> semi-Gothic. The two
aisles are divided from the nave by a grand colonnade.
The façade is of the style of Siena and Orvieto, with cusped
arches under triangular gables; it has a large finely-traceried
rose window in the centre, and a profusion of statues. At
Venzone, also near Tagliamento, is an ancient Lombard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
church with characteristic sculptures, built in 1200. Here
is a holy water vase of a later period, of extremely fine and
finished sculpture, signed Bernardino da Bissone, 1500.
Bernardino also sculptured another holy water vase in the
Duomo of Tolmezzo, and the beautiful door of the church
of Tricesimo. All these works prove the close connection
of our guild with the Patriarchs, who ruled over Venice as
well as Friuli.</p>

<p>Even in 1468, when the Duomo of Cividale was restored
by Pietro Lombardo, several of his brethren worked with
him.</p>

<p>In 1420, the Venetians, led by Roberto Morosini, took
Friuli and annexed it to Venice. By the treaty of Lodi in
1454 they added Bergamo, Brescia, and Crema. Many
Lombards flocked to Venice at that time, and the Masonic
Guild had its schools and <i>laborerium</i> there. From that date
the Masters of the guild were known in Venice as "Mistri
(Masters) Lombardi." Merzario dates from this epoch the
renewed connection of the Comacine Guild with Venice,
but it must have begun much earlier than that, if it had not
continued unbroken from Lombard times. A lodge must
certainly have existed in Venice from the time when the
first Maestro Buono (Vasari's Buono) went there in 1150.
It is unlucky for history that the original Freemasons, being
a secret society, kept no archives. It is only after the twelfth
century, when other art guilds were formed on the same
system, but without the secrecy, that we get an insight
into what had been, all the ages through, the management
of the guild. At Siena, as we have seen, the painters
seceded in the thirteenth century from the universal brotherhood,
and founded their academy of painters, the sculptors
following their lead. They, not being bound to secrecy,
let the world know their statutes and their customs.</p>

<p>The same thing took place in Venice. On September
15, 1307, the sculptors appealed to the Signory of Venice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
for permission to form statutes and hold chapters under
the denomination of the <i>Arte de tajapiere</i> (stone-cutters).
They were not at liberty to form a Masonic or building
guild, because the original one had then the monopoly.
Sig. Agostino Sagredo,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278"  class="fnanchor">[278]</a> in his valuable work on the building
guilds in Venice, says&mdash;"While we are speaking of
the Masonic Companies and their jealous secrecy, we
must not forget the most grand and potent guild of the
Middle Ages&mdash;that of the Freemasons. Originating most
probably from the builders of Como (<i>Magistri Comacini</i>)
it spread beyond the Alps; Popes gave them their benediction,
monarchs protected them, and the most powerful
thought it an honour to be inscribed in their ranks. They,
with the utmost jealousy, practised all the arts connected
with building, and by severe laws and penalties (perhaps
also with bloodshed) prohibited others from the practice
of building important edifices. Long and hard were the
initiations to aspirants, mysterious were the meetings and
the teaching, and to ennoble themselves they dated their
origin from Solomon's Temple." This monopoly would
account for none of the Communes having a civic guild of
architecture; and their secrecy explains the want of documentary
evidence in the earlier centuries, while the
monopoly was undisputed.</p>

<p>The new local branches of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries were evidently absolved from secrecy; they started
fresh as independent companies, and thus freed, art was
able to expand more largely. With this light on its
formation, it is interesting to find in the Venetian Guild
of sculptors, organized in 1307, the self-same rules and
government as in Siena, and all the other cities. We find
the school and <i>laborerium</i> and the usual Administrative
Council of four <i>Soprastanti</i> elected on the first Sunday of
every month, the outgoing officials having to instruct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
new ones. In Venice the Grand Master of the Lodge was
called, as in the ancient Lombard Lodges, <i>Gastaldo</i>; the
chief architect of a work was designated in more classic
language, <i>Proto</i>.</p>

<p>On the third Sunday of the month every Master of the
<i>arte</i> was obliged to pay a gold <i>soldo</i> to the company, which
money was only to be spent for the use of the school.</p>

<p>Again a marked similarity. At the beginning of
November the feast of the <i>Quattro Coronati</i> was kept,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"  class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and
no one was to work on that day under pain of a fine of
100 soldi. There is the usual rule about every Master
bringing a wax candle when he attends a meeting, and
on the day of the Patron Saints the candle must weigh
four ounces. The fines for those who absent themselves
from the <i>fête</i> of the Patron Saints are the same as at Siena,
and so also are the rules about matriculation of members,
the making of contracts, the introduction of foreign
Masters, etc.</p>

<p>The first name of a <i>Gastaldo</i> or Grand Master in the
Venetian Lodge is a Mistro Lorenzo de Vielino in 1407, who
makes a law that no Master shall have more than three
<i>fanti scritti</i> (apprentices?) besides his own sons or brothers.
Sagredo says that the Masters in all these <i>arti</i> were a
privileged aristocracy, whose sons were allowed to enter
the guild without the usual novitiate.</p>

<p>In 1509 Mistro Manfred de Polo was Grand Master, and
decreed a kind of census. Every Master was obliged within
eight days to hand in a list of his relatives in the guild and
the apprentices in his studio.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_389">See page 389.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the lodge were in the little street
known as the Piscina di S. Samuele. The <i>Opera</i> was a
large building, not much decorated, but there was a fine
relief by one of the Lombard Masters over the door. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
was removed, and preserved by the Government when the
building, no longer needful for its former use, was sold.
The altar of the <i>Quattro Coronati</i>, sacred to the guild,
was in the church of S. Samuele close by. Here too
were the tombs of the brethren of the lodge. Unfortunately
none of the funereal inscriptions remain. Cicognara
has, however, preserved two inscriptions on the building
of the lodge, which are valuable as additional proof of
the guild. One beneath the relief on the façade runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><span class="s08">MCCCLXXXII ADI XXV MARZO.</span></p>
<p><span class="s08">IN TEPO D</span>(i)<span class="s08">MA' ANTONIO DA MODON</span> (Modena)</p>

<p><span class="s08">E SCRIVAN MA' DOLZE</span> (Dolce).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here we get the names of the four members of the
ruling council in 1482, all <i>Magistri</i>, and that of the notary
of the guild, Maestro Dolce.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"  class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Another inscription on the
staircase, which was rebuilt in 1686, announces that the
stairs were built by the gifts of the brethren under the
Gastaldo Maestro Domenico Mazzoni, and then follow the
names of his three companions in office, one of whom is
Vincenzo Minella, and that of the notary.</p>

<p>If we now trace some works in Venice we shall see how
intimately connected this lodge was with that of Milan and
other branches of the guild. In 1430 we find Zambono
engaged to decorate the Ca d'Oro or Palazzo Contarini on
the Grand Canal. In his aim at magnificence good Giovanni
Bono of Como not only made the work a masterpiece
of Gothic ornamentation, but he gilded his sculpture
till it was refulgent. It appears that this Zambono, who
could not spell his own name, was not such a master of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
pen as he was of the chisel, for his son Bartolommeo signed
the contract for him on April 20, 1430. The gilding
was done by Giovanni da Francia, whose son Francesco
signed for him.</p>

<p>Bartolommeo Bono worked much with his father, and
later his younger brother Pantaleone joined them, and
became more famous than either of them. To these three
we owe in a great measure the reconstruction and decoration
of the Ducal Palace, which in the first place had been
built by Justinian and Narses. At the end of the tenth
century, the Doge Pietro Orseolo restored Justinian's
building. To this restoration belong probably some of the
fine mediæval capitals of the columns of the Loggia, of
which we have given an illustration on <a href="#Page_257">page 253</a>. It has
been said that Marino Faliero, when Doge, engaged his
friend and fellow-conspirator Filippo Calendario to make a
plan for a new palace, but no proofs of this, nor any designs
are to be found.</p>

<p>Authentic documents, however, prove that a meeting of
the Grand Consiglio was held on September 27, 1422, in
which it was proposed to "rebuild the palace in a decorous
and convenient form." On April 20, 1424, the decree went
forth that the old walls were to be thrown down, and the
façade rebuilt. The first Masters mentioned in the books
are the three Buoni. A minute, dated September 6, 1463,
registers that the Salt Office should pay "Maistro Pantalon,"
sculptor, for the work done for the Ducal Palace&mdash;that this
work included many other works besides the figures; and
that it should not remain incomplete, the Doge wished it to
extend across the piazza and up to the last built Sala<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281"  class="fnanchor">[281]</a>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the Sala del Squittinio. This would include all
the façade and its colonnades, with the internal Sala del
Squittinio and Scala Foscara leading to it, on which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
placed the statue of Francesco della Rovere.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282"  class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The part of
Bartolommeo, brother of Pantaleone, was the Porta della
Carta, of which we speak in the chapter on decoration.
Their father Giovanni (Zambono) must have died about
the time the palace was finished, which was May 13, 1442,
for on November 25, 1443, Bartolommeo writes himself in
a notarial act as "Ego Bartolommeus lapiscida q. ser
Johannis Boni."</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_390">See page 390.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Part of the palace was burned not many lustres after,
and in 1484, Antonio Rizo or Riccio was nominated <i>Proto</i>
for its rebuilding. He came to Venice with good recommendations.
He was the son of a deceased Magister
Giovanni Rizo, as we see in a deed of June 25, 1484, where
he is nominated as "Ser Antonius Rizo lapiscida q. ser
Joannis de contrata sancti Joannis Novi," and had been in
the East, where he built the fortifications of Scutari, for
Antonio Loredan. His fortifications resisted the attack
of the Turks so well that they had to raise the siege, and
Antonio, who was wounded, was rewarded by a pension for
himself and children, and by the appointment of chief
architect for the Ducal Palace, when it was restored after
the fire. It would seem that the façade built by the Buono
trio had not been injured, as Rizo turned his attention
to the inner court, which he built in a beautiful style,
together with the great staircase, now known as the
"Scala dei Giganti," from Sansovino's two giants, which
were added&mdash;not much to the grace of the stairway&mdash;in
1566.</p>

<p>Bernardino da Bissone, and Domenico Solari of Val
d'Intelvi, both Como Masters, assisted in the sculpture of
the beautiful balustrade. Riccio has the characteristic
Comacine mixture of round arches in the foundation, and
pointed ones above. He added a third colonnade, in which
the round arches again appear. It is all enriched by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
exquisite sculptural decoration; the frieze of Nereids and
sea-horses on the third order is very fine.</p>

<p>Selvatico attributes also to Riccio much of the side of
the palace towards the prisons. The two statues of Adam
and Eve facing the Giant's Stairs are signed in the plinths,
one "Antonio," the other "Rizo." They are fine works of
sculpture, which have been wrongly attributed, in spite of
the signature, to various persons, such as Antonio Bregno,
and Andrea Riccio of Padua. A proof of Rizo's lengthened
tenure of the office of <i>Proto</i> is given in a document in the
Venetian archives quoted by Cadorin. The document,
dated October 10, 1491, is an order from the Magistrates
of the Salt Office, who were at the head of the Administration
of the works of the Ducal Palace, "to increase the
salary of Rizo Antonio, <i>Proto</i> of the building works, from
one hundred and fifty ducats to two hundred, as the former
salary was not enough to support his family in his old age,
and also having regard to his long and valuable services and
fatigues, and the necessity of retaining him, for the prosperity
and the beauty of the said building."<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283"  class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Another document, quoted by Merzario from the Diary
of Marin Sanuto, seems to throw a cloud over the close of
Antonio's head membership. It seems that 10,000 ducats
were missing from the accounts of the works, and that
Antonio, being unable to explain it, sold all his possessions,
and shouldering his belongings went towards Ancona and
Foligno. This entry is dated April 5, 1498.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284"  class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

</div>
<p>It is difficult to say who is the Antonio Bregno that is
accredited with Rizo's works. There was a Lorenzo Bregno,
a sculptor to whom Sansovino attributes the statue of the
General Dionisio Naldo of Brisighella (died 1510), which is
placed above the door of San Giovanni e Paolo. There
was also Paolo Bregno, father of Lorenzo, but the name of
Antonio never appears in the books of the Administration,
nor in any archives as far as Sig. Merzario can judge after
a diligent search. As the Bregni were related to Rizo, it
seems probable that this is another misleading case of nicknames,
and that the chief architect's family name was
Bregno; so that Antonio Rizo was only Antonio Bregno,
the "curly-headed"&mdash;from <i>riccio</i>, a curl.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285"  class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>After Riccio, a Magister Bartolommeo Gonella, who
died in 1505, succeeded as <i>Proto</i>, and then Magister
Buono succeeded him. Buono was probably a grandson of
the last Bartolommeo, son of "Zambono." This man, who
signs himself "Bartolomeus de Cumis lapizida," had been
a sea-captain, and sailed in the fleet of Melchiorre Trevisan.
On his return in 1498 he resumed his hereditary profession,
and in 1505 was nominated head of the building works of
St. Mark's, which were now occupying the guild. The
upper order of the "Vecchie Procuratie" was built under
his supervision. The church of San Rocco, built in 1495,
was, however, his first great work in Venice, and the next
was the restoration and heightening of the tower which
another of the Buono family had built in 1150, more than
three centuries earlier.</p>

<p>When in 1516 the erection of the "Scuola di San
Rocco" was proposed, Bartolommeo Buono, the head
architect of the "Vecchie Procuratie," was unanimously
elected. However, when he had drawn his design, and
the edifice began to rise, a certain knowing brother of the
confraternity (<i>un tal saccente confratello d'essa</i>) censured
the plan of the stairs, and the work was suspended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Maestro Buono would not relinquish his design, and
retired; on which Pietro Lombardo was elected in his
place to continue the building. Here we have again a
distinct proof of the Masonic organization, and see that in
Venice they held their meetings to consider the work of
their brethren, just as they had done in Milan, Siena,
Florence, etc.</p>

<p>In 1529 Maestro Buono died, and Jacopo Sansovino
was nominated <i>Proto</i> of the Procuratie in his stead. One
of Buono's principal assistants was Guglielmo da Alzano,
near Bergamo.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"  class="fnanchor">[286]</a> He sculptured a beautiful altar in the
Servite church on the commission of Madonna Verde della
Scala. It is now removed to the church of SS. Giovanni
e Paolo. The great altar in the church of S. Salvadore is
also attributed to him. He was a famous builder as well
as sculptor, and was architect of the Camerlinghi Palace,
at the foot of the Rialto in Venice. The beautiful Tasca
palace at Portogruaro, of which the richly-sculptured
doorway was brought to Venice, was his design, as well as
the fine gate at Padua called the "Portello," and the
"Porta di S. Tomaso" in Treviso.</p>

<p>Several other more familiar Comacine names are found
in Venice, such as Gregorio and Giorgio of Carona, whom
we have seen sculpturing at Udine;<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287"  class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Bernardino di
Martino of Bissone, and Andrea from Milan. Francesco,
son of Bernardo of Como, Simeone of Pietro, sculptor from
Como, with Donato and Giovanni Busata, sons of Ser Piero
da Campione, are all mentioned in the Transactions of the
Guild in Venice about this time. A contract is reported in
the <i>Archivio Veneto</i> (vol. xxxi. anno 1886, fasc. lxii. p. 169),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
signed on July 26, 1476, "between the Fraternity of S.
Maria in S. Daniele and Maestro Giorgio, sculptor of Como,
who, having made several statues for S. Giacomo in Udine,
is herewith commissioned to make three figures in stone
for the door of S. Maria in S. Daniele, <i>i.e.</i> a Madonna and
Child and two angels, the statues to be figures, that may
by any good <i>Magister</i> be judged worthy and beautiful."</p>

<p>Then comes a name which has become synonymous
with the beauty of Venice&mdash;the Lombardi family&mdash;to whom
are attributed all the principal late Gothic and Renaissance
buildings that enrich the city. As usual, the name by
which the family has come down to posterity in the histories
of art is nothing but a misleading nickname. The
Venetians called them the Lombards. Just as Vannucchi
is called Perugino, and Allegri is called Correggio, so the
Solari family were known as Lombardi. They were among
the aristocrats of the guild, however, whose ancestors
had been eminent men for more than a century. We have
seen Marco Solari, and his son Antonio, and also his
grandsons Cristoforo and Guiniforte, at work at Milan,
where Marco, Guiniforte, and Pietro Antonio were successively
chief architects. The Lombardi-Solari of Venice
appear to have been another branch of the family, equally
descended from Giovanni da Carona, through his son
Martino, the father of Pietro Lombardi (Peter of the
Lombards).<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288"  class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>Martino was the architect of the Scuola di San
Marco, near SS. Giovanni e Paolo. His name appears
before that time as "Mistro Martino tajapiera," when he
was, in 1476, sent to Istria to <i>sbozzare</i> the marbles for
the sculptures on S. Zaccaria, of which he was architect,
though his ancestor Antonio di Marco had begun it in 1458.
At the Scuola di San Marco, his son Moro, brother of
Pietro, assisted him, and on Martino's death Moro became
<i>Proto</i> of the works at San Zaccaria, his son Bernardino and
grandson Francesco assisting him. The books of the
Administration of that building have notes of payment,
in 1488, one "to Bernardo, sculptor, son of Moro
our <i>Proto</i>," and another executed on July 20, 1488, where
it is written, "And I Francesco di Bernardo, sculptor from
Como." Other papers prove the sons of Pietro Lombardo
as being Giulio, Antonio, and Tullio. In Tullio's sons two
old family names are revived&mdash;Marco Antonio and Sante.</p>

<p>To this family may be attributed a large part of the
finest fifteenth or sixteenth century buildings of Venice.
Pietro's elder brother Moro built the church of S. Michele
at Murano between 1478 and 1481; and at the same time
designed and directed the building of the Vendramin or
Loredan and the Corner Palaces. Moro had been before
employed by the Loredan family to build a part of the
church of S. Maria in Isola at their expense. No doubt he
was assisted by his numerous relations in the guild.</p>

<p>To Pietro Lombardo belongs the design for the fine
exterior of the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista. In
1475 he sculptured the beautiful monument to the Doge
Pietro Mocenigo, a grand design with seventeen life-sized
figures carved in Istrian marble. His sons Tullio and
Antonio assisted in this. In 1481 he restored the Scuola
della Misericordia, and finished the ornamental gate of the
Scuola dei Battuti. In the same year he won in a competition
for designs for the church of S. Maria de' Miracoli,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
and became head architect of that masterpiece of Renaissance
architecture. Here he has curiously revived
some features of the old Lombard architecture of his
ancestors in art. He has made a raised tribune with a
dome, but it is square instead of semi-circular, and he has
placed two ambones or pulpits, as in the early churches.
Pietro could build in Gothic style as well as Renaissance,
as is shown in the cusped and pinnacled façade of S.
Cristofero della Pace at Murano. The original Torre
dell' Orologio on Piazza S. Marco was also designed by
him.</p>

<p>On March 14, 1499, he was nominated <i>Proto maestro</i>
of the Ducal Palace in place of Antonio Rizo. Seguso
and Selvatico attribute to him, with his sons and nephews,
the rich and beautifully sculptured capitals of the pillars
which support the lower arches "from the Court of the
Senators to the second part of the building"; and the
internal façade of the side towards St. Mark's, which
Selvatico pronounces one of the finest examples of Lombard
style. In the interior of the palace he restored the
"Camera del Tormento," and built the hall of the Council
of Ten, the prisons over the Granaries, and the attic
prisons known as "I Piombi."</p>

<p>As a sculptor he was of remarkable genius. Two
signed statues in the church of San Stefano, one of which
represents S. Antonio, are of extreme beauty, as is the
magnificent high relief of the Virgin and Child in the outer
arcade towards the bridge. The monument to Cardinal
Zeno in S. Marco is a beautiful specimen of Lombard
ornamentation. It is rich with carven angels and saints,
wreaths of flowers, and all possible wealth of sculpture.</p>

<p>In about 1490 Pietro was engaged on a great work of
architecture at Treviso, where the bishop had commissioned
him to improve the cathedral by putting a new and ornate
façade with a large window, besides building three new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
chapels.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289"  class="fnanchor">[289]</a> His sculpturesque tastes outweighed his talent
for architecture. He left the building at Treviso in the
hands of inferior Masters, and went to Venice to sculpture
in the <i>laborerium</i> of the guild at San Samuele, the statues
and reliefs for its façade. The work not proceeding
satisfactorily it was suspended, and on Pietro Lombardo's
death even his design was lost in some mysterious manner.
The church was not ultimately restored till two centuries later.</p>

<p>He had also the commission to restore the older church
of S. Maria Maggiore at Treviso, and there, too, having
made his design, he left his son Tullio to execute it.
Either for want of means, or disagreements among the
Masters, this also remained incomplete. Probably Pietro
had too many interests in Venice, where in 1514 he was
elected <i>Gastaldo</i> or Grand Master of the lodge; in
which office he continued till his death in 1521, a date
proved by his son Tullio taking out papers of administration
in that year. We have no particular mention of any
great buildings by Pietro's eldest son Giulio, but he was
greatly respected in the guild, for on June 3, 1524, the
Chapter of S. Roch, while deliberating that "Mistro Bon,"
<i>i.e.</i> Master Bartolommeo Bono, a famous architect, should
be discharged from the office of chief architect (<i>Proto</i>) of
the Scuola, because he is <i>disobedient and not diligent
enough</i> (we perceive that even a <i>Proto</i> had some
superior officers or council above him), elected as <i>Proto</i> in
his stead a young Magister Sante, son of Giulio Lombardo,
but with the proviso that his father Giulio should be his
adviser in everything.</p>

<p>Antonio, Pietro's second son, won a certain rank as
sculptor, but he is better known in Padua and Ferrara. He
removed to the latter city in 1505 with his family, and died
there in 1515.</p>

<p>The third son, Tullio, however, was a bright star in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
line. His sculpture was so delicate, and he attained such
tenderness in the flesh of his marble statues, that it is
thought he had studied under Donatello when he was in
Padua in 1450. His decorative sculpture may be judged
by the chimney-pieces in the chamber of Udienza, with its
antechamber, in the Grand Ducal Palace; by the doors of
the Scuola di S. Marco, and the church of SS. Giovanni e
Paolo, all done about 1500. The beauty and grace of his
figures may be seen in the four kneeling angels which
support the altar of the Incoronation of the Virgin in
S. Giovanni Crisostomo; a most exquisite group. This
work is signed, "Opus Tullii Lombardi." The fine
monument to the Doge Nicolò Marcello, at SS. Giovanni
e Paolo, and those of Marco and Amerigo Barbarigo, in S.
Maria della Carità, are also by him.</p>

<p>There is some confusion between the two cousins, Sante,
eldest son of Giulio, and Sante, the second son of Tullio.
Sante di Giulio was chief architect of the Scuola di San
Rocco, from June 1524 to March 1527, and all the finest
part of the building is attributed to him. He built the
church of S. Giorgio for the Greek colony. This was
finished in 1548 by Gian Antonio Lombardo da Cione
(Carona), who was son of Pietro Antonio Solari of Carona,
so that in this church the Milanese and Venetian branches
of the Solari family meet, but the Milan branch has kept
the old name, while in Venice it has been merged in the
place name, and they are known as the Lombards. The
Palazzo Trevisan, which belonged to the family of Bianco
Capello, was said to be from the design of Sante.</p>

<p>We have followed up the Venetian architects sufficiently
to prove that they, too, had their links with the great
Comacine or Lombard Guild. Sansovino, who succeeded
the Lombard Solari family in Venice, was a Master trained
in the Florentine Lodge, so even he was not extraneous to
the guild.

<p>Mention has been made, in the second chapter, of the
early Christian Basilicas erected under Constantine, and
the forty-six churches of the same era, which Genseric
destroyed, and how the three Basilicas which were then
saved&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> S. Agnese, San Lorenzo, and S. Maria in
Cosmedin&mdash;have, during subsequent restoration, revealed,
in the parts of the original buildings discovered, a style
precisely analogous to the Basilicas which sprang up in the
north of Italy in the time of the Lombards. The only
difference between the fourth-century Roman churches and
the seventh-century Lombard ones is not in form or style,
but merely a deterioration in workmanship. This may
easily be accounted for by the two or three centuries of
decadence between the destruction of Rome by Genseric
and his successors, in about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 460, when it is supposed
the remnants of the <i>Collegio</i> of architects fled to Como, and
their revival under the Longobardic kings. During those
centuries, no great buildings, or even restoration of
edifices, took place. The Eternal City seemed, even when
free of invaders, to be perishing in the clutches of time.
Charlemagne led the way by rebuilding one or two ancient
temples and palaces, and he established several schools, one
of which was for Lombards&mdash;a proof that he was interested
in those architects, and that they still had a seat in Rome,
where the church of their four Patron Saints had stood,
from the far-off time of Pope Melchiades&mdash;<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 311.</p>

<p>Pope Adrian I. followed the example of his imperial
ally, by restoring several churches, to do which he had to
ask Charlemagne for the builders of the guild under his
protection; a proof that no <i>Collegio</i> existed in Rome at
that time. Among these churches, one of the most interesting
was that of S. Agnese fuori le Mura, a beautiful
round-arched Basilica, built by Constantine in 324. As it
now stands, it is so far below the level of the ground that
there is a long descent of forty-five wide marble steps, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
reach the vestibule of the church. The Basilica itself is
extremely interesting, as it remains in its original eighth-century
form, as Pope Adrian I. restored it in 775. The
plan is a pure and simple Comacine Basilica, with its nave
and two aisles, circular tribune and an upper gallery, with
the <i>cochleus</i> or spiral staircase leading to it all complete.</p>

<p>The columns of the nave seem to have been taken from
an ancient Roman building. The capitals are all classical
except the four nearest the tribune, which are quite
Comacine, with their simple upright volutes. But the
building space being limited, the extremely tall columns
had to be placed in such close juxtaposition, that the round
arches between them are diminished out of all harmonic
proportion. The triforium gallery, having shorter columns,
gives a more pleasing effect.</p>

<p>The spiral staircase leading to this is cut in the thickness
of a pilaster. The mosaics in the tribune are the
original ones of Pope Honorius' time, and of Byzantine
style; the decorative paintings over the whole church are
mere modern frescoes.</p>

<p>But that the sculpturesque decorations were done by the
Comacines, and not by the Greek mosaicists, is suggested
by several remains of the ancient decorations of the church,
which are preserved on the walls of the stairway descending
to it. Here is a <i>pluteus</i>, or stone panel, probably from the
front of the ancient tribune, and it is a beautiful <i>intreccio</i>
precisely like the ones at S. Clemente. Two other panels
of the same parapet are of Roman design. One might
imagine that the Lombard architect copied them from the
inner roof of the Arch of Titus. Probably the guild, being
of Roman origin, kept all these classical decorative designs
in its <i>laborerium</i>.</p>

<p>Now and then, in the ages following Adrian, we find a
large-minded Pope, who gave his thoughts to restoring
the beauties of Rome: such as Leo III. (796), Leo IV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
(845), Innocent III. (1178), Nicholas III. (1277), and
Boniface VIII. (1294). This latter was the Pope who
consecrated the Duomo of Florence.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_567" id="i_567"></a>
<img src="images/i_567.jpg" width="356" height="471" alt="" />

(<i>From a photograph by Alinari.</i>)</p>

<p class="caption"><i><a href="#Page_405">See page 405.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The great Lombard Masonic Guild being under the
especial protection of the Popes, we should expect to see its
members employed in the mediæval buildings of Rome.
And truly, after Adrian's time, here they are. Hope,
Schmarzow, Ricci, and Boito, besides other writers, have
all decided that the ancient cloisters of San Lorenzo&mdash;built
under Honorius III. in the beginning of the thirteenth
century&mdash;as well as the primitive churches of St. Peter, S.
John Lateran, and S. Lorenzo, were all early Comacine
work; and that the exquisite cloister of S. John Lateran,
and the churches of S. Paolo fuori le Mura, Ara C&oelig;li,
San Giovanni e Paolo, S. Maria sopra Minerva, etc., are
all equally Lombard churches of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. Several friezes and inscriptions go to prove the
truth of this, besides those eloquent lions that crouch
beneath the columns in the cloister of S. John Lateran and
other places.</p>

<p>As this is not an architectural dissertation, but merely
a tracing of the work of this great guild, I will keep more
to the inscriptions relative to <i>Magistri</i>, than to a description
of their works, which has been done by so many writers.</p>

<p>In the old times before the painters and sculptors, and
after them the metal-workers, split off and formed companies
of their own, every kind of decoration was practised by the
Masters. A church was not complete unless it were
adorned in its whole height and breadth with either
sculpture, mosaic, or paintings, and this from the very early
times of Constantine and his Byzantine mosaicists, and of
Queen Theodolinda and her fresco-painters, up to the
revival of mosaics by the Cosmati, and the fresco-painting
in the Tuscan schools. But never were those arts entirely
lost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<p>The ideas which the Lombard architects brought up from
Sicily, when working there under the Normans, were the
seeds of re-vivification, and caused a tremendous evolution
in the art of the guild. They saw the decorative value of
mosaic as it was used in the twisted Saracenic columns, and
they were charmed by the rich use of sculpture in the
graceful arches. From that time, every lodge throughout
the land seemed to invent a new style peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>The Romans, with their traditions of classic mosaics,
revived the art in Saracenic style as a means of decoration.
The Tuscans, with their wealth of coloured marbles,
enlarged chromatic decoration into chromatic architecture,
and their airy towers and arched churches were all more or
less polychrome. The Lombards, having no marbles at
hand, took from these same Saracens their rich traceries
and cuspings, which they produced in the plastic clay,
throwing a veil of ruddy beauty over the façades and
arches of their buildings.</p>

<p>The name of the Cosmati family has become generic
for the peculiar chromatic sculpture of Rome in the twelfth
century; the family were complete masters of the art.
But though they may have taken the idea of its revival
as a decorative aid to sculpture, it was by no means
their invention, or even their monopoly. If you look at a
Cosmati pillar or panel, and then at the floor of any Roman
church, you will see that Cosmatesque decoration is but an
adaptation of the old Roman <i>opus Alexandrinum</i>. And we
have plenty of proof of the fact that other <i>Magistri</i> of the
guild also practised it. The ambone in S. Cesareo in
Palatio at Rome, of which we give an illustration, is earlier
than any of Cosimo's family.</p>

<p>There exists at Florence (in S. Leonardo) the ancient
pulpit from S. Piero Scheraggio, and which was said to
have been brought there from Fiesole. Its date is
supposed to be before 1000 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> Though of a ruder style,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
we have the Cosmatesque inlaying of glass and marble, as
a setting to sculptures distinctly Comacine, and of almost
Longobardic antiquity. In Sta. Maria in Cosmedin are
two fine pulpits, on one of which is a beautiful candlestick
formed of a twisted column, inlaid in the same style.
The Comacine lion crouches beneath it, and on the base
is the inscription in Gothic letters, telling us that the
worthy and learned man Paschalis (called Rita), with great
study made this candlestick.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290"  class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Then we have Nicolao di
Rannuncio, whose name is inscribed on the door of inlaid
marble in the church of S. Maria at Toscanella,<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291"  class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and a
whole family whose names are inscribed on the ciborium
of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura:<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292"  class="fnanchor">[292]</a> where it is written&mdash;"John,
Peter, Angelo, and Sasso, sons of Paul the sculptor,
Magisters of this Opera. I, the humble Abbot Hugh, had
this work executed"<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293"  class="fnanchor">[293]</a> (Johs, Petrus, Ange&#774;s, et. Sasso.
Filii. Pauli. Marmo&#772;r. Huj'. Opis. Magister Fuer. Ann
d. M. CXLVIII. Ego. Hugo. Humilis. Abbs. Hoc. Opus.
Fieri Feci.). The tabernacle is of the usual four-pillared
form; the columns are ancient porphyry ones adapted; the
capitals the usual Comacine mixture of classic and mediæval&mdash;acanthus
leaves and cornucopiæ with the mystic beasts
climbing among them.</p>

<p>Angelo, the third son of Magister Paulus, had a son
named Niccolò, and the two together made the candelabrum
of S. Paolo; a quaint mediæval piece of sculpture, of the
style of Magister Roberto's font, but with some marvellously
beautiful interlaced work. There is also Arnolfo with his
partner Peter (Arnolfus cum suo socio Petro), who made
the inlaid and sculptured tabernacle in S. Paolo fuori le
Mura in 1285.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<p>Merzario says that we must not confuse this Arnolfo with
the Florentine architect. Camille Boito, however, opines
that he is the same. Arnolfo had certainly a taste for the
polychrome in architecture, which may or may not have
been imbibed in Rome, while working at that lodge with
Peter&mdash;whom Cavalcaselle considers was one of the Cosmati,
and who certainly did the ciborium at S. Paolo, though
Arnolfo's name is absent in that work. I have found some
other members of the Roman Lodge inscribed above a
bronze door in S. John Lateran. On the archivolt is
written&mdash;"Hui opis Ubert et Petr: F&#865;rs. Ma&#772;gistri Lausenen.
Fecer&#865;unt." Over another bronze door in the sacristy they
are written as&mdash;"Ubert Magister, et Petrus. Ei: Fr.
Placentini Fecerunt Hoc. op.," and the date <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1196.
Boito<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"  class="fnanchor">[294]</a> sees nothing in this but a perplexing contradiction,
that in one place the brothers say they are from Lausanne,
and in another from Piacenza. It is to me plain enough.
They are natives of Lausanne, and consequently Lombards:
they are also brethren of the lodge of Piacenza, where they
had most likely worked while the cathedral and other
buildings were being erected.</p>

<p>The date of the Baptistery door, and the connection of
its maker with the guild, are verified by the inscription on
the other panel of the bronze door, which says it was done
in the fifth year of the pontificate of Pope Celestine III.
(<i>i.e.</i> 1196), and that Father Giovanni, Cardinal of S. Lucia,
the <i>Jubente</i>, or <i>camerarius</i> of the <i>Opera</i>, had it made.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"  class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>This door had engraved on it the design of the ancient
façade of S. John Lateran&mdash;a perfectly Lombard front
consisting of two round-arched arcades, with a little pillared
gallery above.</p>

<p>The door of the Sacristy must have been cast before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
that of the Baptistery, as in the first work Uberto is entitled
<i>Magister</i>, and Petrus only named as his brother, whereas
in the second the younger brother must have also graduated,
and has in his turn attained to the dignity of <i>Magister</i>.</p>

<p>We trace the same gradual progress through the ranks
of the Guild in the Cosmati family, whose connection with
the Roman lodge we must now trace. Several generations
of them were <i>Magistri</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>To Lorenzo belong the façades of Santa Maria in
Falleri, and the Duomo in Civita Castellana, besides the
pulpit in Ara C&oelig;li at Rome. In all these works his son
Jacopo worked with him.</p>

<p>Jacopo alone, with the title of <i>Magister</i>, sculptured the
smaller doors in the façade of the Duomo at Civita Castellana,
and the door of San Saba at Rome in 1205; also the
inlaid columns at S. Alessio in Rome, and the Cloister of
Santa Scolastica at Subiaco. In Civita Castellana, above
the magnificent portal, is inscribed "Laurentius cum Jacobo
Filio suo, Magistri doctissimi Romani H(oc) opus fecerunt."
This proves my assertion that they had graduated in the
Roman Lodge, and if further proof is required, this portal
bears the universal mark of the Comacine Masters at this
era&mdash;its columns rest on lions.</p>

<p>Similar inscriptions are on the ambone of Ara C&oelig;li,
and the doorway at Falleri. The inscription on the door
of San Saba, dated 1205, is&mdash;"Ad honorem domini nostri <span class="s08">I&#862;HU
X&#865;PI</span> Anno VII. Pontificatus domini Innocentii III. <span class="s08">PP</span> Hoc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
opus domino Johanne, Abbate Jubente<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296"  class="fnanchor">[296]</a> factum est per
manus magistri Jacobi." Up to this time we have no
proof that the family was of Roman origin; they are
merely given as members of the Roman Lodge, which we
have seen was of Lombard origin. They were afterwards
made Roman citizens.</p>

<p>After these works we find Cosmato, the son of Jacopo,
old enough to assist him. That same frontal of the Duomo
at Civita Castellana has on the cornice over the portico
these words inlaid in letters of gold&mdash;"Magister Jacobus
civis Romanus cum Cosma filio suo, Fieri fecit hoc opus
<span class="s08">A. D&#864;NI. MCCX</span>." Cosmato's name is also inscribed as
assisting his father in the door of the church of San Tommaso
in Formis at Rome. Next, in 1224, we find young
Cosmato a full-fledged <i>Magister</i>, working at the cathedral
of Anagni, which was in those days an important city, and
the residence and birthplace of several Popes. The whole
pavement there is a beautiful work of inlaid marbles, and
bears an inscription saying that the Venerable Lord Bishop
Albert had the pavement made; Magister Rainaldo, Canon
of Anagni to Pope Honorius III., and the honourable sub-deacon
and chaplain assisting in the expense, which was a
hundred gold <i>oboli</i>; Magister Cosmato executing the work.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297"  class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
Magister Rainaldo, the Canon, must have been one of the
ecclesiastic members of the guild, and showed so much
respect for the privilege that he preferred the title of
<i>Magister</i> to the grander one of <i>Venerabilis</i>, to which his
office of Canon would have given him right.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span></p>

<p>After this time, Cosmato is always written as Magister;
his name appears on the altar of the crypt of S. Magnus in
the cathedral of Anagni, which was also a commission of
Bishop Alberto in 1230. Next, we perceive that Cosmato
has married and has a goodly family of sons, who,
according to ancient custom, are all educated in the
guild.</p>

<p>Luca and Jacobo, the two eldest, helped him in the
mosaic pavement of the crypt at Anagni, and in the cloister
of Santa Scolastica at Subiaco. This is a most beautiful
work in transition style. The columns are alternately
single and double, the single ones with a wide projecting
abacus. Some are slight and straight, others spiral and
beautifully inlaid between the sculptured ribs. The arches
resting on these fanciful columns are on two sides round,
but on the other sides are slightly pointed. Above the
arches is a sculptured cornice and a frieze of mosaic. It is
altogether very beautiful.</p>

<p>In 1277 Cosmato was employed by Pope Nicholas III.
to restore the chapel "Sancta Sanctorum" in the Basilica of
S. John Lateran, the altar of which was reserved for the
Popes alone. Luca appears to have died young, but Jacopo
at eighty years of age was a master builder at the cathedral
of Orvieto, where in 1293 he is written in the books as
"Maestro de' Muratori Jacopo di Cosma Romano."</p>

<p>The third son, Adeodatus, or Deodatus, rose high in the
guild. In the pavement of S. Jacopo alla Lungara, before
it was destroyed, the following epigraph was inlaid, which
was copied by Crescimbeni&mdash;"Deodatus filius Cosmati, et
Jacobus fecerunt hoc opus." In a later work, the ciborium
once in S. John Lateran, now in the cloister, we find that
Deodatus has risen to the rank of <i>Magister</i>. It was a
commission from the Colonna family, whose arms are
sculptured on it. The ciborium in S. Maria in Cosmedin,
ordered by Cardinal Gaetani, nephew of Pope Boniface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
VII., must have been earlier than this, for he has merely
signed "Deodat. me fec."</p>

<p>Cosmato's fourth son, Giovanni, first appears in an
independent work in 1296, when, on the elegant sepulchre
of Bishop Durante, he signs&mdash;"Jo&#862;hs filius Magri Cosmati
fec&#772; hoc op." Similar epigraphs are on the tomb of Cardinal
Gonsalvo in S. Maria Maggiore, and a monument to
Stefano de' Surdi in Santa Balbina.</p>

<p>In all these works of the Cosmati, Camille Boito finds
signs of Lombard principles, and traces in the development
of style from father to son the same gradual movement from
older forms towards the Gothic, which we notice between
Jacopo Tedesco and Arnolfo, and between Niccolò Pisano
and his son Giovanni. Living in Rome, however, the
Cosmati never really took up the Gothic style, as it developed
further north; but always kept nearer to classical
forms, and so prepared Rome for the Renaissance style,
which arose from the humanist movement in the Cinque-cento
epoch.</p>

<p>The next great patron of the Lombard Guild in Rome
was Pope Nicholas V. (Thomas of Sarzana), of whom
Gregorovius said&mdash;"This man had only two passions&mdash;collecting
books and building." His dominating idea was
the directing of a new Renaissance. According to him,
"Rome ought to become the imperishable monument of
the Church, or rather the Papacy, and re-arise in admirable
magnificence before the eyes of all people."<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298"  class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Nicholas V.
had the first idea of the rebuilding of St. Peter's, and the
Vatican, but one man's life was not long enough for such
great works. He, however, restored the Campidoglio,
Castel S. Angelo, San Todaro, S. Stefano Rotondo, the
palace of S. Maria Maggiore, the fountain of Trevi, the
walls of Rome, and several of the State fortresses.</p>

<p>He got some of his architects, such as Leon Battista
Alberti and Rossellino, from the Florentine Lodge, but by
far the greater part of them were Lombards. The chief of
these was Master Beltramo da Varese, of whom we have
heard much in the Lombard Lodges. With him were his
nephew Maestro Pietro di Giovanni, Maestro Paolo da
Campagnano (a village near Varese), and Maestro Giacomo
di Cristoforo. Rossellino had begun the works at St.
Peter's in a kind of reverse fashion, starting with the apse.
The continuation of this tribune was confided to Maestro
Beltramo, who set to work in good earnest. He made vast
lime and brick furnaces, filled the <i>laborerium</i> with wood,
ropes, ladders, etc., engaged sub-architects and <i>Magistri</i>
with bands of workmen under them, most of whom came
down from the Como region. In fact, there was an army
of Lombards.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299"  class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The registers of the <i>Opera</i>, now in the
Vatican, mark large payments to Magistro Beltramo and
his nephew Pietro di Giovanni, who became chief architect
after his uncle's death.</p>

<p>Besides the Tribune of St. Peter's, the two relatives
were employed to rebuild the Campidoglio. Muntz
publishes some notes taken from the registers of the
Apostolic Camera, recording payments made between 1447
and 1448 to Maestro Beltramo, and some of his associates
(<i>socii</i>), for the roof and marble windows of the Campidoglio
and the palace of the Conservators. In 1452 Pietro da
Varese is found continuing the work alone. The documents
recently published from the registers of the Vatican
have these entries&mdash;</p>

<p>"1452. <i>December 31.</i>&mdash;To Maestro Pietro da Varese,
nephew of Maestro Beltramo, 1000 gold ducats for part of
the Tower he is building behind the Campidoglio, at the
side where they sell salt by retail. T. S. 1452, fol. 216,
cf. fol. 194."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span></p>

<p>"1453. <i>March 9.</i>&mdash;D. 112, b. 56, d. c., for remainder and
completion of the contract of the Tower he (Pietro) has
made at the Campidoglio, which in full amounts to 1212
ducats, of which he received last year at different times,
1000 (and 100) ... and thus it is registered by Janni di
Jordani (Notary V. fl. 126. 10. 93)."<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300"  class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>We find Pietro in 1450 sculpturing in the cathedral at
Orvieto, where in a public act he is described as a good
and clever sculptor ("lapidum sculptor bonus et doctus"),
and prayed to remain at Orvieto in the service of the
lodge there.</p>

<p>Muntz speaks very highly in praise of the Lombard
sculptor, Giacomo di Cristoforo<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301"  class="fnanchor">[301]</a> da Pietrasanta, saying
that although his name is little known to biographers, he
holds a high place in Roman art of the fifteenth century,
and merits to be ranked among the most celebrated artists
of his time. Many of the buildings which Vasari ascribes
to Giuliano da Majano and Baccio Pontelli are in reality
due to him; for instance, the Palazzo Venezia, which was
rebuilt under Pope Paul II. (Pietro Barbo, who succeeded
to the papal throne in 1464). Now Giuliano da Majano
only came to Rome towards the end of the reign of Pope
Sixtus IV., and could not therefore have been employed by
Paul II. In fact, Muntz, after many researches, concludes
that the chief architect was Maestro Giacomo da Pietrasanta,
who is in the registers of 1467 qualified by the title of
<i>Soprastante</i> in the <i>laborerium</i> of the church and palace
of S. Marco at Rome, and in 1468 is written as the president
of the building of the Palazzo Apostolico or Vatican.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302"  class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
In fact, Giacomo da Pietrasanta, the Lombard, was Grand
Master of the whole Roman Lodge during these years.</p>

<p>But Maestro Giacomo was not the only Comacine
employed in the Palazzo Venezia. A contract dated June
16, 1466, names Magister Manfred of Como and Andrea of
Arzo, whom we have seen in Venice, as <i>magistros architectos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"  class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
and the registers reveal a whole army of master builders
and sculptors whose names will be found in the list appended.
Muntz quotes no less than twenty-five, many
of whom have been familiar to us at Milan, Siena, and
Florence.</p>

<p>Although when Calixtus III. (Alfonso Borgia) succeeded
Nicholas V. in 1455, he had no great ideas about resuscitating
the architectural glories of ancient Rome, he nevertheless
employed the Lombard Masters to finish the works
begun. Maestro Pietro da Varese, and Maestro Paolo da
Campagnano, with Maestro Antonio di Giovanni from
Milan, and Maestro Paolino da Binasco, were joint architects
of the Pontifical Palace. Maestro Bartolommeo da
Como, whom we have known at Milan and Pavia, was
director of the works of fortification at Castel S. Angelo,
while Maestro Stefano da Bissone di Como is named as a
sculptor in the church of S. Spirito.</p>

<p>The next Pope, Pius II. (Æneas Silvio Piccolomini),
did so much building and embellishing in Siena&mdash;where
the Lombard Masters divided the honours with their colleagues
born in Siena, and trained by them&mdash;that he did
little for Rome. He employed the same Pietro da
Giovanni and Paolo da Campagnano between 1460 and
1463, for the roof of S. Pietro, which menaced destruction.
The palace of the Vatican was placed under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
architectural superintendence of Maestro Manfred of Como
and Domenico of Lugano. The first appears to have
been designing architect, and the second master builder,
as he commanded squadrons of workmen, and was assisted
in ruling them by his brother Antonio.</p>

<p>Maestro Angelo da Como, and a certain Martino
Lombardo, rebuilt the chambers which had been destroyed
by fire, and adorned the "Hall of the Pavilion" and "Hall
of the Parrot."</p>

<p>In the time of Sixtus IV. (Francesco della Rovere,
1471-1484) the Lombards of the Roman Lodge were
joined by their brethren from Florence, and now we find
the two groups inextricably mixed. Baccio Pontelli and
Giuliano da Majano work together with Manfred the
Lombard and Paolo da Campagnano in the administration
of the works of the Vatican; while Francesco and Andrea,
both Lombards, are found carving in wood and executing
beautiful doors in <i>intarsia</i>, together with Giovanni and
Marco di Dolci, Florentines; Giovanni de' Dolci with his
colleagues (chiefly Comacines) worked at the Sixtine
Chapel, some parts of the Vatican, and the fortress of
Civita Vecchia, which Baccio Pontelli finished. Pope Innocent
VIII. (Cibo, 1484-92) added the Loggia Belvedere to
the already immense palace of the Vatican, and Alexander
VI., a Spaniard, built the Borgia apartment, for which he
employed Antonio di San Gallo, or from St. Gall, a
Lombard naturalized Florentine, whose assistants in the
work seem to have been chiefly Lombards.</p>

<p>It was this influx of Florentines, who were fresh from
the humanistic influences of the classic revival of literature
under the Medici, and therefore more open to further inspirations
from the influences of antique Rome, which
brought about the revival of classic forms in architecture
in Rome. Bramante and San Gallo began it in 1503,
Raphael and Michael Angelo carried it on; and such hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
did the Renaissance style take on the minds of people
in the late Cinque-cento era, that it spread, and overpowered
the Gothic from end to end of Italy.</p>

<p>Vasari raved about the faults of the old architecture
and its <i>goffissima</i> style, upholding the chastened order of
the new, but whatever may have been the merits of Renaissance,
as Bramante and Michael Angelo practised it, their
later followers committed quite as many sins against reason
and good taste as any Comacine or Romanesque architect
ever did. Look, for instance, at the church of S. Carlo, in
the Corso at Rome, with its gigantic pilasters running up
the whole height of a front, which is, by its square windows,
cut up into three storeys, giving the lie to the unity of space
implied by the mock columns; and at San Firenze in
Florence, where half an arch runs up into the air and stops
short, as a defiance to all laws of gravity. Arches or pediments,
with a <i>hiatus</i> where the key-stone should be, and
which, logically speaking, can support nothing, are the most
common blots on a late Renaissance building.</p>

<p>But we have nothing to do with this era. It was only
a late survival of a side issue of the Comacine Guild which
had been practically dissolved before Michael Angelo's
time, although the influence of its smouldering ashes
vivified the art even of that great genius.</p>

<p>The great family of sixteenth-century architects, the
Fontana, was of Comacine origin, though I believe the
guild was dissolved by their time. Domenico Fontana
was born at Melide near Como; his elder brother Giovanni,
famous for his stucco work, had preceded him in Rome,
but Domenico was an artist of a wider kind. The Cardinal
Felice di Montalto soon discovered his capacities, and
entrusted him with the erection of the Cappella del Santissimo
in S. Maria Maggiore. Here a very unusual episode
occurred. The Cardinal had not means enough to finish
the work, and the brothers Fontana, instead of suing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
for their pay, lent him 1000 scudi. Of course the Cardinal
was their great patron after this, and recommended them
to Pope Sixtus V., who employed them in the Vatican to
build the Belvedere and the Library. Domenico also enshrined
the Scala Santa at S. John Lateran; he placed the
obelisks on Piazza S. Giovanni and Piazza S. M. Maggiore;
set up the Castor and Pollux on the Quirinal; built the
bridge at Borghetto, the hospital of S. Sisto, and restored
the Alessandrini-Felice aqueduct; embanked the Fiumicino
near Porto; made the water conduit at Civita Vecchia,
which implied tunnelling under a mountain; and the great
aqueduct of Acqua Paola from Bracciano to Rome, thirty-five
miles long; besides constructing fountains everywhere,
in Rome and Frascati.</p>

<p>In fact, he nearly made Cinque-cento Rome. His brother
Giovanni was nominated architect in general to Pope
Clement VIII.; and Paul V. made him chief architect of
St. Peter's, with his nephew Carlo Madernò. He too was
employed in Ferrara. For a century the name and race
of Fontana flourished in Rome, some of the family emigrating
to Naples, where they became equally famous. The
number of their buildings was legion; they and the family
Della Porta, who also came to Rome from Lake Lugano,
divided the renovation of Rome between them. Girolamo
della Porta, like the Fontanas, was a naturalized Roman.</p>

<p>The Fontana family forms a link with Naples, though
not the only connection of that city with the guild. The
Comacine Masters kept up their connection with Naples
long after the time of the Normans, when Maestro Buono
built the Castel Capuana for William I. Merzario claims
for one of his descendants, Buono dei Buoni, the credit of
having first invented painting in oils, which he is supposed
to have taught privately to Antonello of Messina.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304"  class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Several names of the Solari family, so famous at Milan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
and Venice, turn up at Naples in the fifteenth century,
and then a famous work was put into Lombard hands.
When Alphonso of Aragon made his entry in 1443, the
governors of the city decreed that a triumphal arch should
be built to commemorate the event. It was placed at the
entrance of Castel Nuovo, and consists of two round towers,
with an arch between them, supported on Corinthian
columns. The arch is surmounted by a frieze and cornice,
with a parapet above, enriched with bas-reliefs representing
the entry of King Alphonso. The whole is surmounted
by statues of saints and the cardinal virtues.</p>

<p>The construction of this fine arch has been attributed
to Giuliano da Majano, but as he was at the time only a
boy of ten or twelve years old, this could not be. Sig.
Miniero Riccio, after a diligent search in the Neapolitan
archives, has found some acts, which give the names of
sculptors employed on this. We find Pietro di Martino
from Milan, head architect; Isaja da Pisa, Domenico di
Montemignano, Antonio da Pisa, Francesco Arzara, Paolo
Romano, and Domenico Lombardo. This authorship is
confirmed by the epigraph in the church of S. Maria la
Nuova in Naples, dated 1470, in memory of Pietro di
Martino, Milanese, who, for his merit in erecting the arch
at Castel Nuovo, was created Cavalier by King Alphonso,
and a sepulchre was given in this church for him and
his descendants.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305"  class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>If the date had only been a little later, we might have
supposed this to be Pietro Lombardo, son of Martino
Solario, who had won such fame in Venice; but as he died
in 1512, it is scarcely likely he would have been well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
enough to have obtained such an important commission in
1440. Knowing how a certain succession of names was,
and is, kept up in Italian families, this Pietro and Martino
might have been the father and grandfather of the Martino
da Carona, father of Pietro Lombardo, especially as they
had Domenico, also a Solari, with them.</p>

<p>King Alphonso was a good patron to the Comacine
Masters, and greatly appreciated them. On February 16,
1456, a gentleman at Terracina wrote to the Duke
Francesco Sforza, saying that <i>some master builders from
Como</i>, in leaving the realm of Naples, had been made
to forfeit 190 ducats, on which they appealed to the King.
Alphonso ordered the restitution of the money, excepting
a small tribute to the confiscators, which he made good
to the Comacine Masters out of his own purse.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306"  class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>From 1484 to 1508, a Maestro Tomaso da Como, sometimes
called <i>Tomaso delle parti di Lombardia</i>, master
sculptor, was living in Naples. He was paid for the
carving of the principal door of the church of the Annunziata,
which his son Giovanni finished after his death.
His will still exists. It is dated July 2, 1508, and says
that "Mastro Tomaso de Sumalvito (now Sanvito) de la
terra de Como de la parti di Lombardia, marmorario habitante
in Napoli: istituisce herede Joan Thomaso de
Sumalvito de Napoli suo figlio," and declares besides that a
debt of three ducats is still owing to him on the work for
the great doorway of the church of the Annunziata. The
fine monument to Signor Antonio d'Alessandro and his wife,
Maddalena Riccio, in the church of Monte Oliveto, and that
of the Bishop of Aversa in the same church, were sculptured
by Tommaso de Sanvito, as he is called in the books of
Orvieto, where he was head architect.</p>

<p>His son Giovanni built, in 1509, the fine chapel of the
Macellai in the church of S. Eligio, and the "Confession"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
of S. Gennaro under the tribune of the cathedral of Naples,
where the yearly miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of
S. Gennaro takes place. Even the beautiful Royal Palace
at Capodimonte was built by a Lombard, Domenico Fontana
of Melide, near Como, whose family we have seen was more
famous in Rome than in Naples? Domenico, however, died
in Naples in 1607, and was buried in S. Anna dei Lombardi,
where his sons Sebastian and Julius Cæsar (Giulio Fontana)
wrote on his tomb&mdash;"Patritius Romanus, Summus Romae
Architectus. Summus Neapolis." Like so many of his
predecessors in the guild, he had been given the citizenship
of the towns he had embellished. It is this which makes
it so difficult to trace the artists&mdash;the same man may appear
successively as being a citizen of Rome, of Orvieto and
Siena, and yet have been born at Como in spite of all.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that at Rome and
Naples, as well as in other cities, the great Lombard Guild
led the way. The guild, which may be looked on as the
flower of the Renaissance, had, however, reached the period
when its blossoming time was over; its many petals, too
much spread, were falling from all its branches. Some
had dropped off long since, and new suckers formed in
the painting academies, and the sculptors' companies, at
Siena, Florence, Venice, and other parts. These suckers
had, by the fifteenth century, grown into independent
plants, that threatened to overshadow and choke the ancient
trunk. Art knowledge of all kinds had now become dispersed
outside the jealous custody of the once secret Freemasonry,
and the Cinque-cento artist stood alone on his
own merit, without needing the <i>cachet</i> of the Masonic title
of <i>Magister</i>. There were, after this time, Masters in every
other art or trade guild, the nomenclature of this most
ancient and universal of guilds having been adopted by all
other guilds whatsoever; so that even in our own England
we find Master Humphrey the iron-worker, or Master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Ambrose the cloth-weaver; and in Italy Maestro Giorgio
the maker of majolica, and Maestro Pollajuolo the metal-worker;
and in Germany the "Little Masters," who, I opine,
were a German group of painters, who, like their brethren
of the South, seceded from the Masters <i>par excellence</i>, i.e.
the great Masonic Guild.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>

<p>When I began writing this work, my object was to
prove that the Comacine Masters were the true mediæval
link between Classic and Renaissance Art. The results
have been greater than I then foresaw. In attaching this
link in its true place, the chain of Art History takes a new
and changed aspect, and instead of several loose strands
with here and there detached links, it becomes one continuous
whole, from early Christian Rome to the Rome of Raphael
and Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>The famous artists who formed the rise of the different
schools of the Renaissance, were not each a separate genius
inspired from within, but brethren of one Guild, whose
education was identical, and whose teachers passed on to
them what they received from their predecessors&mdash;the
accumulated art-teaching of ages.</p>

<p>I am aware that in tracing the progress of this great
Guild, the weak points are the derivation of the Comacines
of Lombard times from the Roman public architects, who
built for Constantine and Pope Adrian; and the connection
of this Lombard Guild with the early Cathedral builders of
the eleventh and twelfth centuries.</p>

<p>Between each of these transitions there lies a century or
two of decadence, during the barbaric invasions and general
demoralization which I have indicated in the earlier
chapters. But I think I have given arguments enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
prove these affinities. For the first, we have the identity of
form and ornamentation in their works, and the similarity of
nomenclature and organization between the Roman <i>Collegio</i>
and the Lombard Guild of <i>Magistri</i>. Besides this, the
well-known fact that the free republic of Como was used as
a refuge by Romans who fled from barbaric invasion, makes
a strong argument.</p>

<p>For the second, we may plead again the same identity
of form and ornamentation, and a like similarity of organization
and nomenclature. Just as King Luitprand's architects
were called <i>Magistri</i>, and their grand master the <i>Gastaldo</i>,
so we have found the great architectural Guild in Venice, in
the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, using the
very same titles, and having the same laws.</p>

<p>In the Tuscan schools which have been traced direct
from Lombard times, we have the same offices with the
titles translated into a more mediæval Italian&mdash;or late Latin&mdash;form;
the <i>Gastaldo</i> here becomes <i>Arch Magister</i>. In
some Lodges it is more significant still, the ancient Roman
<i>Superstans</i> is modified into <i>Soprastante</i>, thus forming a very
suggestive connection between early Christian Rome and
Tuscany. Again, the hereditary descent is marked by the
patron saints of the Lombard and Tuscan Lodges, being four
martyr brethren from a Roman <i>Collegio</i>. All these and
other indications are surely as strong as documental
proof.</p>

<p>The lists of the Comacine Guild begin with a few
masters, who are seemingly members of three or four
families only, the men of the Buoni, Antelami, and
Campione schools forming the aristocracy of the Guild.</p>

<p>We have seen how, as the church-building era developed,
the brotherhood grew and multiplied.</p>

<p>The Antelami family founded Lodges in Parma, Padua,
and Verona; the Campione at Modena, Bergamo, and Cremona;
the Buoni family spread eastwards to Venice, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
southwards to Tuscany, founding everywhere <i>laboreriums</i>
and schools.</p>

<p>Three hundred years later we see the descendants of the
Buoni and Campione artists together, building the Gothic
and Renaissance palaces at Venice; masters of the Graci
and Antelami families rearing the cathedrals of Siena and
Orvieto; and in all the ages dispersing about Italy from
north to south. We have seen how all these schools
increased; native artists joining the Lombard ones, and
working together with them, and though a distinctive local
style was the characteristic of each school, yet in their fundamental
principles they all had one rule and one teaching.</p>

<p>As the Guild increased and multiplied, in the times of the
foundation of rival Communes, all vying with each other in
building glorious churches, noble palaces, and fine houses, it
frequently happened that the primitive Lombard element
was overpowered by the newer local one, and then schisms
and disintegration took place.</p>

<p>Separate local Guilds were thus formed at Venice, Siena,
and Florence.</p>

<p>The painters next seceded, and started painting as an
art independent of church decoration; and thus the
Academies of Art were formed. This split took place so
late after the city <i>Arti</i> or Guilds were established, that the
painters of Florence, having left the Freemasons, had no
Guild of their own; and if they wished to enjoy civic
privileges, they had to enroll themselves in the Company
of the Gold-workers, or that of the Apothecaries. Here
we get at once a clear explanation of the goldsmith painters
in Florence.</p>

<p>This disintegration reached its climax when Brunellesco
defied the <i>Maestranze</i> or Masonic Magisters, proving that
the Freemasons had not the exclusive right to genius; and
that genius had its own claims to be heard, even without
the pale of that monopolizing Guild. I think that his dome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
literally crushed out the almost effete institution of Freemasons,
and that the Florentine Lodge was broken up soon
after; for by Michael Angelo's time the Medici had to
supply a school for sculptors, which we have seen was
placed under the instruction of old Bertoldo,&mdash;a lingering
relic of the great company.</p>

<p>At first sight it might appear that this revelation of
the universal fraternity would materially alter the history
of art. In some aspects it does; for we can no longer
say that Maitani built Siena cathedral, or Arnolfo that of
Florence, nor assert that St. Mark's at Venice was entirely
Byzantine, or Milan cathedral the work of a German
architect. They were all the joint labours of the same
brotherhood of artists, the plans made by the first Arch-master
being modified a score of times as the centuries
went on, and art developed. But in the great points
the story of Art remains as it was. Certain masters still
stand out as leaders and founders of schools, and every
school had its own separate bias and special development
of style; but Niccolò di Pisa's influence on future ages
is not lessened by our finding out the masters who trained
him; the Lorenzetti, Memmi, and Gaddi are not the less
famous because their frescoes illustrated with divine truths
the walls built by the hands of their brethren of the great
Guild.</p>

<p>The recognition of the complex brotherhood only
renders history more compact and concentrated, giving it a
rich and perfect unity, and showing a gradual and consistent
development, like some perfect flower which grows leaf by
leaf, bud by bud, until the petals fall from its own over-blossoming.
But its seeds are left to future ages.

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The Charter Richard II. for the year 1396, quoted in the <i>Masonic
Magazine</i> (1882), has the following entry&mdash;"341 Concessimus archiepiscopo
Cantuar, quod, viginti et quatuor lathomos vocatus ffre Maceons et viginti
et quatuor lathomos vocatos ligiers ... capere ... possit." Here then
at Canterbury is the same thing as at Milan, and all other ancient cathedral-building
cities,&mdash;the master builders are Freemasons, <i>i.e.</i> of the great and
universal guild,&mdash;the underlings who assist them have not the same rank and
privilege. The Act Henry VI., c. 12, 1444, says in queer mixed parlance&mdash;"Les
gagez ascun frank mason ou maister Carpenter nexcede pas par le
jour IIIJ d. (denari) ovesque mangier &amp; boier ... un rough mason and
mesne Carpenter ... III d. par le jour." Here we recognize the
same distinction of grades between the master who has matriculated and
the mason of lower grade. It is interesting also to note that the master
carpenter is equally a Freemason as well as the master builder. In Italy
the same peculiarity is noticeable; the <i>magister lignamine</i>, whose work
was to make scaffoldings and roofs, is a member of the <i>Maestranze</i>, just as
much as the <i>magister lapidorum</i>, and yet a master in wood is never a stonemason.
The members seem to have been grounded in all the branches,
but only graduated in one of them. The author of the article "Freemason"
in the <i>New English Dictionary on Historical Principles</i>, seems to
be perplexed over the expression "<i>maestre mason de franche peer</i>"
("master mason of free-stone"); but this is merely the equivalent of the
Latin <i>magister lapidus vivum</i>, from <i>Saxum vivum</i>, free-stone, which
merely means a sculptor, in distinction to an architect, who was <i>magister
inzignorum</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> At one era in Lombard times a law was made that no marble was to be
used in building, except by royal persons&mdash;which accounts for all the
Lombard churches being sculptured in <i>Saxum vivum</i>, or free-stone.
There may have been a similar custom in England where marble was
scarce.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> There were other five martyrs of the Masonic guild, whose names

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Mrs. Jameson finds the Santi Quattro illustrated in a predella in
Perugia Academy. In one scene they are kneeling before the Emperor
with their implements in their hands. In another they are bound to four
columns and tortured. In a third they are in an iron cage and being
thrown into the sea. In their own church they are represented as lying in
one sarcophagus with crowns on their heads. In sculpture they also occur
on the façades of several early churches; on the Arco di S. Agostino, and
lastly on Or San Michele at Florence, where Nanni di Banco had so much
trouble in squeezing the four of them into one niche, that Donatello had
to help him. These sculptures were placed by the <i>Arte</i> of masons and
stone-cutters, and they naturally chose their patron saints.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Ricci (<i>Dell' Architettura</i>, etc.) tells us the spiral column was very
anciently used in Asia, and that Rome did not adopt it till Hadrian's
return from the East. Under the later Cæsars it became usual, but it fell
into disuse in the rest of Italy. The Byzantines used it in some buildings,
and in these two early Longobardic imitations of the East, we have a
curious masonic link with the ancient traditions of Solomon's Temple, which
Josephus tells us was adorned with spiral columns. It may be that they
were old Roman columns carried up the mountain from some ruin, but I
should rather take them as one of the first instances of the use of the spiral
column by the Comacines, a form to which they were devoted in later
times. There are endless instances of spiral colonnettes on the façades of
Romanesque churches of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

at Rome, which though originally said to have been founded by Constantine,
is not of Greek form, but preserves a perfect Basilican plan. It
was enlarged by Pope Symmachus in the fifth century, and he, it is known,
employed Italian artists. The spiral stairway (<i>cochlea</i>) is also mentioned
at Hexham in England.</p>

Symmachus, when in 477 he held a synod there, has the same peculiarity.
The elongated piers are here placed between every two columns, and are
transverse, <i>i.e.</i> the greater width across the church. Before this time the
roofs were always formed of gable-shaped frames of wood, erected on
beams resting on the side walls, but Ricci sees in this the first advance
towards the arched roof. We may see the next step in the old Lombard
church at Tournus in France, where a succession of arches are thrown
across the nave from the piers.</p>

Symeon of Durham, that the churches of Monkswearmouth and Jarrow
were rebuilt by the monks of Durham after 1075, and that the church of
Wearmouth could not have been built on the same site, because in the
account of the House at Wearmouth, 1360, the old church is mentioned
incidentally as used for a barn or storehouse (Parker's Introduction); but
allowing that to be the case, it is by no means improbable that the old
doorway was retained and removed to the new church.</p>

Port of Pisa. These may have been some of the architect's distant
descendants, but we have no clue as to his ancestors. The name would
seem to have been a nickname, and not his baptismal one, for in another
round church which he built in Pisa, the Knights Templars' church of S.
Sepolcro, it is engraved, "Hugius operis Fabricator <span class="s08">D&#862;STESALVET</span> nominatur."

called Ghirlandajo; the iron-worker Niccolò Grossi, called Caparra; Antonio
Allegri, called Correggio; Francesco Barbieri, known as Guercino; Alessandro
Buonvicino, called Moretto da Brescia (the dark man from Brescia);
Pietro Vanucci, Perugino; Andrea Vanucchi, del Sarto; Michelangelo
Amerighi, nicknamed Caravaggio; Domenico Zampieri, styled Domenichino;
and hundreds of others. No doubt the Buschetto architect of
Pisa was only another instance; probably he had a shock head of hair and
was nicknamed "the little bush."</p>

the window-sills are hewn and shaped smoothly for half their length, the
other half being left in the rough. Zucchari has done the same with his
door-lintels and window-panels. The effect is an incongruity, not pleasing
to the eye.</p>

uses glass mosaic as an illustration of the sacrament of penance. "Penance
is a great furnace: it receives glass and changes it into gold. It takes
lead and makes it silver.... Have you seen glass, how it is made of the
colour of beryl, emerald, and sapphire? You cannot doubt, too, that
penance makes silver of lead and gold of glass. If human art knows how
to mix nature with nature, and change what was before, how much more
would the grace of God be able to effect? Man has added gold-leaf to
glass, and in appearance that seems gold which was before glass. If man
had chosen to mix in gold, the glass would have been made golden; but
avoiding the cost, he invented the fitting together and inserting the thinnest
leaf."</p>

weighing less than half-a-pound, and was to make an offering for the maintenance
of the chapel, etc., of whatever he could afford. The Rector (Grand
Master) was obliged by oath to enforce the strict observance of the day,
and to fine any Magister who, being in Siena, should absent himself from
the meeting, fifteen soldi, besides the offering he ought to have made. They

Venetian archives. One is a deed dated Sept. 19, 1492, drawn up by the
notary Gerolamo Bossis. It confirms the will of Magister Petrus Lombardus
quondam Martini lapiciola. Another, dated Sept. 8, 1479, drawn
up by the notary Bartolommeo de Vegiis, begins&mdash;"Io piero lombardo
fiolo di ser martino de charona, tajapiera in Venesa in la chontrada
de samoele in casa del duse testimonio e scrive de mano propria."
Here Pietro tells us not only his father's name Martin, but his birthplace
Carona, a village near Arogno and Campione&mdash;the place his relative
Marco da Carona came from. In fact here we have the Campionese
school still surviving and sending forth fine artists.</p>
